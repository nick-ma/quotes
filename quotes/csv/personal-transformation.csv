"“Wrecked and despondent at midlife, I need to undertake a strict personal evaluation that will lead to personal transformation. I must be willing to start afresh and attempt to make myself anew. In order to begin all over and not culminate in the same deadhead rut as before, I admit to harboring personal insecurities and boldly confront my greatest fears. In order to establish an altered foundation that will support a revised self, I commence by asking the pertinent questions. If I run fast enough and long enough, can I quash slavish personal demons and capture an elusive self? Can I exercise the self-discipline to eliminate the artificial screens that I hide behind in order to peer out at the formidable world? Do I possess the personal audacity to explore unfamiliar terrain and the internal grit to dual the primal flex of nature’s power while accepting on equal terms the thrall and tragic beauty of surviving in a violent habitat?” ― Kilroy J.

"“Personal Transformation is so much personal.You shouldn't talk about it with anyone.You must remain absent while remaining present till you are ready.

"“We attract behaviour. Period.A deep realisation which had made me apologise and seek forgiveness of the one who had thrown a glass of water on my face sometime in 1978. Imagine what I might have said to provoke such a reaction! I had found him after 17 years to ask for his forgiveness. I had embarked on a search of ten of such individuals from all across. One whom I was not able to locate, I had incidentally found traveling in train.No, personal transformation is not easy. Don't indulge in it if you are not willing to make the efforts which would be essential. If that strong and intense desire is there, then trust me you will attract the right person, right voice and a right mentor or coach.To listen to that top, nay, that deep and therefore, a little weak voice, will need you to be cautious and attentive before it gets snubbed by the noise around.

How I was able to love and forgive and heal from the inside out to create a wild and beautiful life where I am free. The process of revisiting and reconciling has been terrifying and transformative, rage-inducing and revolutionary. Through it all, the truth has been laid bare to honor the moments where I was reborn. Once I ventured into the Elysian Fields of my own truth and power, there was no returning to a world so small that it no longer contained my expansion.

We regenerate with a brighter inner flameAs we seek our light through the shadows.” ― Christine Evangelou, Rocks Into Roses: Life Lessons and Inspiration for Personal Growth"
"“We must engage our sense of self to sensibly deal with environmental stresses in the ever-changing world. Without a strong sense of self and an equally robust ego, I might have expired long ago. Because I possess a brain that is capable of self-recognition and self-regulation, I reserve the opportunity to edit personal behavior. If I can exercise the necessary self-discipline, I can reposition an individualistic and egotistical sense of self-identity. A sense of self can lock us into self-destructive behavioral patterns. If we exhibit an inflexible sense of self, we are predisposed to act in a rigidly prescribed manner. Some of our personal decisions might not support our long-term best interest. The Neanderthals failed to adapt to environmental changes and paid the ultimate price with extermination of their species. I too face the challenge of either adapting to environmental stresses or expiring. My prior characterization of self-identity did not serve me well since it brought me to the brink of self-immolation. Accordingly, I must revise whom I think I am in order to adapt to the challenges of a rapidly changing environment by assessing who I was, determining who I want to become, and developing a disciplined approach to make the transition from what I was to who I seek to become.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"

"“All those persons who ride high on the clouds of perfection refuse to accept that they could become better persons.” ― Balroop Singh"
"“This lasting change can essentially be achieved in two ways: through suffering or through wisdom. Either we painfully push forward through any obstacle or disappointment, learning our lessons the hard way and emerging from the experience more mature, or we choose a path of love, consciousness, and wisdom, which also makes us mature, but in a far more enjoyable and effective manner.” ― Nebo D. Lukovich, Inner Peace, Outer Success: The Reintegration System: Spiritual Growth, Healing, Solving Problems and Achieving Goals with Cutting-Edge Mind Techniques"
"“Many people achieved important goals in their lives, but hardly any of them seemed any happier for it. Even worse, some complained that other areas of their lives had suffered along the way. The reason is simple: they didn’t change the framework components of their personality—beliefs, decisions, and other subconscious structures that are typically negatively-oriented. Those basic structures had been triggered by the fulfillment of the goal and were subsequently creating a mess in people’s lives.” ― Nebo D. Lukovich, Coherence: The Ultimate Guide to Accomplishing Goals and Achieving Success Without Side Effects"
"“... some of the most significant moments of growth, change, and transformation I've experienced were born in times of challenge and difficulty. This leaves me with a choice: I can fight the natural order of things, crying ""Why God? Why?"" or I can learn to go with the flow.” ― Joan Ball, Flirting with Faith: My Spiritual Journey from Atheism to a Faith-Filled Life"

"“It is your thoughts that make you think you need to be someone other than who you are. Yet you are not a thought. You simply are. And what you are is the only you there is. The only you there will ever be.” ― Purejoojoo"
"“I commence the act of personal transformation by unreservedly accepting the inevitability of my death. When I thrust aside fear of death, I become a new person, I transmute into a reformed person who is unafraid. The fear of the unknown does not hold me down. Free from attachment to life allows me to embrace personal ugliness and admit to my decided paltriness. I am no longer ashamed of my personal deformities. I embrace my impermanence with a candid shrug of the shoulders and a slight nod of the head of that conveys utter indifference. Now unhampered by awareness of my transience, I can act by using this limited window in time to paint myself for how I, and only I, see fit.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"

"“One of the remarkable features of the human brain is its integral plasticity, the ability to reorganize itself adaptively in response to hitherto unsuspected stimuli in the external environment. The neuroplasticity of the human brain enables it to alter neural pathways and synapses due to changes in behavior, environment, neural processes, thinking, emotions, as well as changes resulting from bodily injury. The outcome of a person’s life is not fixed or fated. I need to take advantage of this evolutionary gift of the adaptability of the human brain by learning from prior experiences, consciously integrating desirable behavioral patterns, and eliminating destructive thoughts and habits. I must eliminate exterior posturing, scrupulously examine personal thoughts and desires, and diligently labor to expand my interiority. I shall efface an existing persona and eradicate all that I previously stood for.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"
"“Our survival responses form a central cord of our emotions. We are receptive, compassionate beings that respond with both body and mind to global stimuli. Our ability to think, learn, and comprehend is closely aligned to the complexity of our lives. People tend to develop the qualities and traits that they need to live. Survival demands that our cognitive abilities and emotional cordage match the challenges presented by our environment. Our capacity to plan correlates directly to our cognitive abilities and the desire to alleviate our present level of anxiety.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"
"“Radical measurable changes in the way we act require cognitive alteration. Shifts in ethical and moral perspective are essential catalysis for pronounced personal conversion. Transforming who and what we are is an exhaustive process. We need physical and emotional stamina to push towards a desired cognitive makeover. Without great effort, we remain mentally stagnant and everything that is stagnant has commenced the dying process. We can use crisis in our lives to promote personal growth.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"
"“[God] desires to do more than ""help out"" a bit. He wants to completely transform us. He wants to take a timid heart and set it ablaze with strength and courage, so much so that people know something supernatural has taken place--life change just as miraculous as fire coming down from heaven.” ― Francis Chan, Erasing Hell: What God Said About Eternity, and the Things We've Made Up"

Today I can honestly say that I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that human beings are capable of making radical and lasting change. After a decade of coaching individuals and leading groups, I have discovered that if I don’t buy into people’s perceptions of who they are and what they are capable of, I can bypass their public personas and see who they are in their highest expression. With a little effort, I can see their magnificence and their potential no matter what they look like or what condition their emotional, spiritual, or financial world is in. I can see through their acts, their personas, their fears and insecurities. I can see who they are apart from the baggage they carry around. The undeniable fact is that underneath all of our public personas, we already are that which we desire to be.

To leave your mark in the world, you will have to stand someplace you’ve never been willing to stand before. And you will have to have the courage to aspire to excellence. To create an extraordinary life you will have to be present in each moment and give 100 percent of yourself. You will have to commit each day to being the best you can be, and aspire to perform your daily tasks in the most conscious way possible. Living your best year requires you to take a moment each time you’re about to make a move—whether you are about to deliver a communication, make a decision, or put something into your body—and make sure that move reflects the very highest choice you could make. ” ― Debbie Ford, The Best Year of Your Life: Dream It, Plan It, Live It"
