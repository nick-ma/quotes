"“I think if I've learned anything about friendship, it's to hang in, stay connected, fight for them, and let them fight for you. Don't walk away, don't be distracted, don't be too busy or tired, don't take them for granted. Friends are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff.” ― Jon Katz"
"“I have great faith in fools - self-confidence my friends will call it.” ― Edgar Allan Poe, Marginalia"
"“If he’s not calling you, it’s because you are not on his mind. If he creates expectations for you, and then doesn’t follow through on little things, he will do same for big things. Be aware of this and realize that he’s okay with disappointing you. Don’t be with someone who doesn’t do what they say they’re going to do. If he’s choosing not to make a simple effort that would put you at ease and bring harmony to a recurring fight, then he doesn’t respect your feelings and needs. “Busy” is another word for “asshole.” “Asshole” is another word for the guy you’re dating. You deserve a fcking phone call.” ― Greg Behrendt"

"“I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.” ― C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity"
"“I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you.” ― C. JoyBell C."

"“Therefore, dear Sir, love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you. For those who are near you are far away... and this shows that the space around you is beginning to grow vast.... be happy about your growth, in which of course you can't take anyone with you, and be gentle with those who stay behind; be confident and calm in front of them and don't torment them with your doubts and don't frighten them with your faith or joy, which they wouldn't be able to comprehend. Seek out some simple and true feeling of what you have in common with them, which doesn't necessarily have to alter when you yourself change again and again; when you see them, love life in a form that is not your own and be indulgent toward those who are growing old, who are afraid of the aloneness that you trust.... and don't expect any understanding; but believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.” ― Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet"

"“I'm about to make a wild, extreme and severe relationship rule: the word busy is a load of crap and is most often used by assholes. The word ""busy"" is the relationship Weapon of Mass Destruction. It seems like a good excuse, but in fact in every silo you uncover, all you're going to find is a man who didn't care enough to call. Remember men are never to busy to get what they want.” ― Greg Behrendt"

And it's the most painful thing you'll ever have to do and that you've ever done. But what's yours is yours. Whether it’s up in the sky or here in your hands. And one day, it'll fall from the sky and hit you in the head real hard and that time, you won't have to put it back in the sky again.” ― C. JoyBell C."

"“I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death.” ― Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom: Autobiography of Nelson Mandela"
"“To have Faith in Christ means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.” ― C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity"

"“Over the years, I have come to realize that the greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity, or power, but self-rejection. Success, popularity, and power can indeed present a great temptation, but their seductive quality often comes from the way they are part of the much larger temptation to self-rejection. When we have come to believe in the voices that call us worthless and unlovable, then success, popularity, and power are easily perceived as attractive solutions. The real trap, however, is self-rejection. As soon as someone accuses me or criticizes me, as soon as I am rejected, left alone, or abandoned, I find myself thinking, ""Well, that proves once again that I am a nobody."" ... [My dark side says,] I am no good... I deserve to be pushed aside, forgotten, rejected, and abandoned. Self-rejection is the greatest enemy of the spiritual life because it contradicts the sacred voice that calls us the ""Beloved."" Being the Beloved constitutes the core truth of our existence.” ― Henri J.M. Nouwen"

"“What was love, really? Flowers, chocolate, and poetry? Or was it something else? Was it being able to finish someone's jokes? Was it having absolute faith that someone was there at your back? Was it knowing someone so well that they instantly understood why you did the things you did—and shared those same beliefs?” ― Richelle Mead, Last Sacrifice"
"“I dont think that we're meant to understand it all the time. I think that sometimes we just have to have faith.” ― Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember"

"“Now very much against her will, she thought of the way Jace had looked at her then, the blaze of faith in his eyes, his belief in her. He had always thought she was strong. He had showed it in everything he did, in every look and every touch. Simon had faith in her too, yet when he'd held her, it had been as if she were something fragile, something made of delicate glass. But Jace had held her with all the strength he had, never wondering if she could take it--he'd known she was as strong has he was.” ― Cassandra Clare, City of Glass"
"“You can never really know someone completely. That’s why it’s the most terrifying thing in the world, really—taking someone on faith, hoping they’ll take you on faith too. It’s such a precarious balance, It’s a wonder we do it at all. And yet..” ― Libba Bray"

"“According to Vedanta, there are only two symptoms of enlightenment, just two indications that a transformation is taking place within you toward a higher consciousness. The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light-hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities. And this accelerates to the point where you actually experience the miraculous. (quoted by Carol Lynn Pearson in Consider the Butterfly)” ― Deepak Chopra, SynchroDestiny: Harnessing the Infinite Power of Coincidence to Create Miracles"
"“To be rejected by someone doesn't mean you should also reject yourself or that you should think of yourself as a lesser person. It doesn't mean that nobody will ever love you anymore. Remember that only ONE person has rejected you at the moment, and it only hurt so much because to you, that person's opinion symbolized the opinion of the whole world, of God.” ― Jocelyn Soriano, Mend My Broken Heart"
"“Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control.” ― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons"
"“There are times when solitude is better than society, and silence is wiser than speech. We should be better Christians if we were more alone, waiting upon God, and gathering through meditation on His Word spiritual strength for labour in his service. We ought to muse upon the things of God, because we thus get the real nutriment out of them. . . . Why is it that some Christians, although they hear many sermons, make but slow advances in the divine life? Because they neglect their closets, and do not thoughtfully meditate on God's Word. They love the wheat, but they do not grind it; they would have the corn, but they will not go forth into the fields to gather it; the fruit hangs upon the tree, but they will not pluck it; the water flows at their feet, but they will not stoop to drink it. From such folly deliver us, O Lord. . . .” ― Charles Spurgeon"
"“Some things have to be believed to be seen.” ― Madeleine L'Engle"
"“Well, it's true that I have been hurt in my life. Quite a bit. But it's also true that I have loved, and been loved. and that carries a weight of its own. A greater weight, in my opinion. It's like that pie chart we talked about earlier. in the end, I'll look back on my life and see that the greatest piece of it was love. The problems, the divorces, the sadness... those will be there too, but just smaller slivers, tiny pieces.” ― Sarah Dessen, This Lullaby"
"“Faith is about doing. You are how you act, not just how you believe.” ― Mitch Albom, Have a Little Faith: a True Story"

"“No pain that we suffer, no trial that we experience is wasted. It ministers to our education, to the development of such qualities as patience, faith, fortitude and humility. All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God . . . and it is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we come here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in heaven.” ― Orson F. Whitney"

"“Faith consists in believing what reason cannot.” ― Voltaire, The Works: Voltaire"
"“Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.” ― Rabindranath Tagore"
"“Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark. If we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be... a prudent insurance policy.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert"

"“Work without love is slavery.” ― Mother Teresa"

"“I believe in intuitions and inspirations...I sometimes FEEL that I am right. I do not KNOW that I am.” ― Albert Einstein"
"“If we can just let go and trust that things will work out they way they're supposed to, without trying to control the outcome, then we can begin to enjoy the moment more fully. The joy of the freedom it brings becomes more pleasurable than the experience itself.” ― Goldie Hawn"
"“My soul is in the sky.” ― William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream"
"“Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves.” ― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons"
"“Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!” ― Jocelyn Soriano, Mend My Broken Heart"
"“Dance. Smile. Giggle. Marvel. TRUST. HOPE. LOVE. WISH. BELIEVE. Most of all, enjoy every moment of the journey, and appreciate where you are at this moment instead of always focusing on how far you have to go.” ― Mandy Hale, The Single Woman–Life, Love, and a Dash of Sass: Embracing Singleness with Confidence"

"“Persistence. Perfection. Patience. Power. Prioritize your passion. It keeps you sane.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“About once or twice every month I engage in public debates with those whose pressing need it is to woo and to win the approval of supernatural beings. Very often, when I give my view that there is no supernatural dimension, and certainly not one that is only or especially available to the faithful, and that the natural world is wonderful enough—and even miraculous enough if you insist—I attract pitying looks and anxious questions. How, in that case, I am asked, do I find meaning and purpose in life? How does a mere and gross materialist, with no expectation of a life to come, decide what, if anything, is worth caring about?Depending on my mood, I sometimes but not always refrain from pointing out what a breathtakingly insulting and patronizing question this is. (It is on a par with the equally subtle inquiry: Since you don't believe in our god, what stops you from stealing and lying and raping and killing to your heart's content?) Just as the answer to the latter question is: self-respect and the desire for the respect of others—while in the meantime it is precisely those who think they have divine permission who are truly capable of any atrocity—so the answer to the first question falls into two parts. A life that partakes even a little of friendship, love, irony, humor, parenthood, literature, and music, and the chance to take part in battles for the liberation of others cannot be called 'meaningless' except if the person living it is also an existentialist and elects to call it so. It could be that all existence is a pointless joke, but it is not in fact possible to live one's everyday life as if this were so. Whereas if one sought to define meaninglessness and futility, the idea that a human life should be expended in the guilty, fearful, self-obsessed propitiation of supernatural nonentities… but there, there. Enough.” ― Christopher Hitchens, Hitch 22: A Memoir"

"“There will always be someone willing to hurt you, put you down, gossip about you, belittle your accomplishments and judge your soul. It is a fact that we all must face. However, if you realize that God is a best friend that stands beside you when others cast stones you will never be afraid, never feel worthless and never feel alone.” ― Shannon Alder"
"“There's a reason we refer to ""leaps of faith"" - because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable, and I don't care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove to you through scripture that their faith is indeed rational; it isn't. If faith were rational, it wouldn't be - by definition - faith. Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face-first and full-speed into the dark. If we truly knew all the answers in advance as to the meaning of life and the nature of God and the destiny of our souls, our belief would not be a leap of faith and it would not be a courageous act of humanity; it would just be... a prudent insurance policy.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love"

"“there is a God, there always has been. I see him here, in the eyes of the people in this [hospital] corridor of desperation. This is the real house of God, this is where those who have lost God will find Him... there is a God, there has to be, and now I will pray, I will pray that He will forgive that I have neglected Him all of these years, forgive that I have betrayed, lied, and sinned with impunity only to turn to Him now in my hour of need. I pray that He is as merciful, benevolent, and gracious as His book says He is.” ― Khaled Hosseini"
"“You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.” ― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values"

"“The Lord works from the inside out. The world works from the outside in. The world would take people out of the slums. Christ would take the slums out of people, and then they would take themselves out of the slums.The world would mold men by changing their environment.

"“This is one more piece of advice I have for you: don't get impatient. Even if things are so tangled up you can't do anything, don't get desperate or blow a fuse and start yanking on one particular thread before it's ready to come undone.

If we could only be miserable all the time, if there could be no such things as love or beauty or faith or hope, if I could be absolutely certain that my love would never be returned: how much more simple life would be. One could plod through the Siberian salt mines of existence without being bothered about happiness. Unfortunately the happiness is there. There is always the chance (about eight hundred and fifty to one) that another heart will come to mine. I can't help hoping, and keeping faith, and loving beauty. Quite frequently I am not so miserable as it would be wise to be.” ― T.H. White, Ghostly, Grim and Gruesome"

"“I marveled at the beauty of all life and savored the power and possibilities of my imagination. In these rare moments, I prayed, I danced, and I analyzed.

"“I'm Losing Faith in My Favorite CountryThroughout my life, the United States has been my favorite country, save and except for Canada, where I was born, raised, educated, and still live for six months each year. As a child growing up in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, I aggressively bought and saved baseball cards of American and National League players, spent hours watching snowy images of American baseball and football games on black and white television and longed for the day when I could travel to that great country. Every Saturday afternoon, me and the boys would pay twelve cents to go the show and watch U.S. made movies, and particularly, the Superman serial. Then I got my chance. My father, who worked for B.F. Goodrich, took my brother and me to watch the Cleveland Indians play baseball in the Mistake on the Lake in Cleveland. At last I had made it to the big time. I thought it was an amazing stadium and it was certainly not a mistake. Amazingly, the Americans thought we were Americans.I loved the United States, and everything about the country: its people, its movies, its comic books, its sports, and a great deal more. The country was alive and growing. No, exploding. It was the golden age of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The American dream was alive and well, but demanded hard work, honesty, and frugality. Everyone understood that. Even the politicians.Then everything changed.” ― Stephen Douglass"

No one gets upset about the belief that rocks fall down as opposed to up, because all sane people can see it with their own eyes. Not so for the belief that babies are born with original sin or that God exists in three persons or that Ali is the second-most divinely inspired man after Muhammad. When people organize their lives around these beliefs, and then learn of other people who seem to be doing just fine without them--or worse, who credibly rebut them--they are in danger of looking like fools. Since one cannot defend a belief based on faith by persuading skeptics it is true, the faithful are apt to react to unbelief with rage, and may try to eliminate that affront to everything that makes their lives meaningful.” ― Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"
"“Being in a hurry. Getting to the next thing without fully entering the thing in front of me. I cannot think of a single advantage I've ever gained from being in a hurry.

It turns out I was throwing it away.” ― Ann Voskamp, One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are"

After that, silence.” ― C.S. Lewis, A Grief Observed"

"“They knew how to live with nature and get along with nature. They didn't try too hard to be all men and no animal. That's the mistake we made when Darwin showed up. We embraced him and Huxley and Freud, all smiles. And then we discovered that Darwin and our religions didn't mix. Or at least we didn't think they did. We were fools. We tried to budge Darwin and Huxley and Freud. They wouldn't move very well. So, like idiots, we tried knocking down religion. We succeeded pretty well. We lost our faith and went around wondering what life was for. If art was no more than a frustrated outflinging of desire, if religion was no more than self-delusion, what good was life? Faith had always given us answer to all things. But it all went down the drain with Freud and Darwin. We were and still are lost people.” ― Ray Bradbury, The Martian Chronicles"

Where the head should have been, there was only a wild foliage of ferns and flowers. There was a small, smiling face drawn over the heart. To find the balance you want,"" Ketut spoke through his translator, ""this is what you must become. You must keep your feet grounded so firmly on the earth that it's like you have four legs, instead of two. That way, you can stay in the world. But you must stop looking at the world through your head. You must look through your heart, instead. That way, you will know God.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love"
"“What I have a problem with is not so much religion or god, but faith. When you say you believe something in your heart and therefore you can act on it, you have completely justified the 9/11 bombers. You have justified Charlie Manson. If it's true for you, why isn't it true for them? Why are you different? If you say ""I believe there's an all-powerful force of love in the universe that connects us all, and I have no evidence of that but I believe it in my heart,"" then it's perfectly okay to believe in your heart that Sharon Tate deserves to die. It's perfectly okay to believe in your heart that you need to fly planes into buildings for Allah.” ― Penn Jillette"

"“Although it is very easy to marry a wife, it is very difficult to support her along with the children and the household. Accordingly, no one notices this faith of Jacob. Indeed, many hate fertility in a wife for the sole reason that the offspring must be supported and brought up. For this is what they commonly say: ‘Why should I marry a wife when I am a pauper and a beggar? I would rather bear the burden of poverty alone and not load myself with misery and want.’ But this blame is unjustly fastened on marriage and fruitfulness. Indeed, you are indicting your unbelief by distrusting God’s goodness, and you are bringing greater misery upon yourself by disparaging God’s blessing. For if you had trust in God’s grace and promises, you would undoubtedly be supported. But because you do not hope in the Lord, you will never prosper.” ― Martin Luther, The Sermons Of Martin Luther"

"“Instead of being encouraged to feel completely protected, loved, honored, and respected by the Divine Force, you've been taught that you're being judged.

"“Surrender is the ultimate sign of strength and the foundation for a spiritual life. Surrendering affirms that we are no longer willing to live in pain. It expresses a deep desire to transcend our struggles and transform our negative emotions. It commands a life beyond our egos, beyond that part of ourselves that is continually reminding us that we are separate, different and alone. Surrendering allows us to return to our true nature and move effortlessly through the cosmic dance called life. It's a powerful statement that proclaims the perfect order of the universe.When you surrender your will, you are saying, ""Even though things are not exactly how I'd like them to be, I will face my reality. I will look it directly in the eye and allow it to be here."" Surrender and serenity are synonymous; you can't experience one without the other. So if it's serenity you're searching for, it's close by. All you have to do is resign as General Manager of the Universe. Choose to trust that there is a greater plan for you and that if you surrender, it will be unfolded in time. Surrender is a gift that you can give yourself. It's an act of faith. It's saying that even though I can't see where this river is flowing, I trust it will take me in the right direction.” ― Debbie Ford, Spiritual Divorce: Divorce as a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life"

"“Yet the upcoming year was going to be a new phase of my life. I would get to follow my big brother to the big house. I had reached that golden age of six. Finally, I was going to experiencethe real deal. This was no appetizer, or tater tots, or French fries. This was the whole Ore-Ida. I would be amongst thechaos like all the neighborhood kids. Everyone that knew Jerry would get to know me, too.Since we were at Aunt Kathy’s, I had to curtail my exuberance. We had nothing like the freedom at mom’s shack. So, I did my best to remain out of sight. But those efforts were futile. School was just hours away. I really couldn’t contain myself without medication or God forbid, a good old-fashioned ass beating.Well, Aunt Kathy implored me to settle down. She kept issuing threat after threat with such statements, “Boy, do I needto beat the black off of you,” or “Gorilla will be your name whenI’m finish!” Yes, I got the message but beating my butt wasn’t going to be enough. Heck, I had been waiting for three long, long years just to join Jerry. Anything short of a bullet wasn’t going to stop me.” ― Harold Phifer, My Bully, My Aunt, & Her Final Gift"

"“Addiction"" might be the best word to explain the lostness that so deeply permeates society. Our addiction make us cling to what the world proclaims as the keys to self-fulfillment: accumulation of wealth and power; attainment of status and admiration; lavish consumption of food and drink, and sexual gratification without distinguishing between lust and love. These addictions create expectations that cannot but fail to satisfy our deepest needs. As long as we live within the world's delusions, our addictions condemn us to futile quests in ""the distant country,"" leaving us to face an endless series of disillusionments while our sense of self remains unfulfilled. In these days of increasing addictions, we have wandered far away from our Father's home. The addicted life can aptly be designated a life lived in ""a distant country.""

"“Depression is about anger, it is about anxiety, it is about character and heredity. But it is also about something that is in its way quite unique. It is the illness of identity, it is the illness of those who do not know where they fit, who lose faith in the myths they have so painstakenly created for themselves. [...] It is a plague - especially if you add in its various forms of expression, like alcoholism, anorexia, bulimia, drug addiction, compulsive behaviour of one kind or another.

"“The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it emotionally. A higher paradox confounds the emotion as well as reason and there are long periods in the lives of all of us, when the truth as revealed by faith is hideous, emotionally disturbing, downright repulsive.

In prosperity, and whenever there is nothing to injure or make him afraid, he remembers Him not, and is ready to defy Him; but place him in the midst of dangers, cut him off from human aid, let the grave open before him, then it is, in the time of his tribulation, that the scoffer and unbelieving man turns to God for help, feeling there is no other hope, or refuge, or safety, save in his protecting arm.” ― Solomon Northup, Twelve Years a Slave"

Those words were worse than nothing if I didn't tell what they meant to Grandpa. Looking at the long rough box, I spoke timid, in a mumbled voice. Not preachified at all. ""Grandpa didn't think Jesus meant, by that, that we should ast God for things, or for special favors. He said we could trust that in the nature of things, without astin', we'll get lots of blessin's and happy surprises and maybe a miracle or two. When Jesus said ast and you'll get it, He meant things of the spirit, not the flesh. Right now for instance, I could ast, 'Lord please raise Grandpa from the dead,' but it wouldn't happen. But I can say, 'Please, God, comfort me,' and I'll get heart's ease. Grandpa said Jesus meant us to ast for hope, forgiveness, and all that. Ast, 'Hep us not be scared, hep us not be greedy, give us courage to try."" I was really carried away. ""Ast any such and God will give it to you.

"“Faith is a great thing, and really religious people would like us to believe that faith and knowing are the same thing, but I don't believe that myself. Because there are too many different ideas on the subject. What we know is this: When we die, one of two things happens. Either our souls and thoughts somehow survive the experience of dying or they don't. If they do, that opens up every possibility you could think of. If they don't, it's just blotto. The end.” ― Stephen King, Pet Sematary"

"“I went to the recreation room and knelt down in front of the same Nativity scene where I’d prayed to Baby Jesus to find my mother when I was a child. I looked at him lying there in his bed of hay and wondered why this scene never left me. Over the years, whenever I prayed, I prayed to Baby Jesus. He was the miracle baby who never grew up.

"“[The] insistence on the absolutely indiscriminate nature of compassion within the Kingdom is the dominant perspective of almost all of Jesus' teaching.What is indiscriminate compassion? 'Take a look at a rose. Is is possible for the rose to say, ""I'll offer my fragrance to good people and withhold it from bad people""? Or can you imagine a lamp that withholds its rays from a wicked person who seeks to walk in its light? It could do that only be ceasing to be a lamp. And observe how helplessly and indiscriminately a tree gives its shade to everyone, good and bad, young and old, high and low; to animals and humans and every living creature -- even to the one who seeks to cut it down. This is the first quality of compassion -- its indiscriminate character.' (Anthony DeMello, The Way to Love)...What makes the Kingdom come is heartfelt compassion: a way of tenderness that knows no frontiers, no labels, no compartmentalizing, and no sectarian divisions.” ― Brennan Manning, Abba's Child: The Cry of the Heart for Intimate Belonging"

"“Gifts of grace come to all of us. But we must be ready to see and willing to receive these gifts. It will require a kind of sacrifice, the sacrifice of believing that, however painful our losses, life can still be good — good in a different way then before, but nevertheless good. I will never recover from my loss and I will never got over missing the ones I lost. But I still cherish life. . . . I will always want the ones I lost back again. I long for them with all my soul. But I still celebrate the life I have found because they are gone. I have lost, but I have also gained. I lost the world I loved, but I gained a deeper awareness of grace. That grace has enabled me to clarify my purpose in life and rediscover the wonder of the present moment.” ― Jerry Sittser, A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows through Loss"
"“The human ego is the ugliest part of man. We lift up men who only show us darkness, and put down those brave enough to show us the light. Likewise, people engage in darkness when it is light outside, and acknowledge the light only when it is dark. We abandon those fighting for us to cheer behind those fighting against us. And, we only remember good people and God when it is convenient for us, and take them for granted because their doors are always open - only to chase after closed doors and personalities void of substance and truth.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“I prayed that our growth would be as strong and determined as the seeds of coconut palms, boldly reaching skyward toward the sun diligently boring deeper into the earth to secure a firm foundation for the beautiful, durable, fruit-bearing trees they would become. For me, Mhonda was the place to continue the growth of the still young but strong roots of my tree planted in Kifungilo. This was my life now, the life I’d prayed for, the life that would provide me with an education and would open doors. I wanted this life very much. I told my wavering spirit to bear with me because, just like the coconut palm, I would sway and bend and bruise, but I would survive.

So why is man your god, and not the Creator?” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“God’s revelation does not need the light of human genius, the polish and strength of human culture, the brilliancy of human thought, the force of human brains to adorn or enforce it; but it does demand the simplicity, the docility, humility, and faith of a child’s heart.” ― E.M. Bounds, Power Through Prayer"
"“I love to walk. Walking is a spiritual journey and a reflection of living. Each of us must determine which path to take and how far to walk; we must find our own way, what is right for one may not be for another. There is no single right way to deal with late stage cancer, to live life or approach death, or to walk an old mission trail.” ― Edie Littlefield Sundby, The Mission Walker: I was given three months to live..."
"“If faith never encounters doubt, if truth never struggles with error, if good never battles evil, how can faith know its own power?

Besides, if our actions are driven only by reward or punishment--eternal or otherwise--then they are motivated by greed and selfishness, not faith or love. That is where so many people go wrong, even those who say they believe [...]. They obey because the think it will make their *lives* better, rather than *themselves*. And that is very much the wrong reason.” ― James Islington, The Light of All That Falls"
"“For centuries the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind to overcome the heart. Condemning religion as the opiate of the masses. They denounce God as a hallucination - a delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science's ignorance! What is wrong with the admission that something exists beyond our understanding? The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day people stop needing faith!” ― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons"
"“God existed before every religion; He exists in spite of all religions.” ― Danail Hristov, The End of the Jesus Era"
"“A person who is truly cool is a work of art. And remember, original works of art cost exponentially higher than imitations. Just take a look at the the coolest people in history. They will always be a part of history for being extremely original individuals, not imitations.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“Faith is always coveted most and needed most urgently where will is lacking; for will, as the affect of command, is the decisive sign of sovereignty and strength. In other words, the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely—a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience. From this one might perhaps gather that the two world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, may have owed their origin and above all their sudden spread to a tremendous collapse and disease of the will. And that is what actually happened: both religions encountered a situation in which the will had become diseased, giving rise to a demand that had become utterly desperate for some ""thou shalt."" Both religions taught fanaticism in ages in which the will had become exhausted, and thus they offered innumerable people some support, a new possibility of willing, some delight in willing. For fanaticism is the only ""strength of the will"" that even the weak and insecure can be brought to attain, being a sort of hypnotism of the whole system of the senses and the intellect for the benefit of an excessive nourishment (hypertrophy) of a single point of view and feeling that henceforth becomes dominant— which the Christian calls his faith. Once a human being reaches the fundamental conviction that he must be commanded, he becomes ""a believer.""Conversely, one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such a freedom of the will [ This conception of ""freedom of the will"" ( alias, autonomy) does not involve any belief in what Nietzsche called ""the superstition of free will"" in section 345 ( alias, the exemption of human actions from an otherwise universal determinism).] that the spirit would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and possibilities and dancing even near abysses. Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.” ― Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science: With a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs"

"“We see them as they cannot, will not, see each other--we see his heart in the way he looks at her; we see her soul calling out for his every touch. It would be so easy if they could only see inside each other as we can.And yet, there is beauty in the way they find each other: slowly, in a fragile dance of sidelong glances and accidental touches. To see them come together, souls binding without knowing each other as we do, without being certain of what the other's heart holds, is to learn something new...Faith.” ― Amie Kaufman, Their Fractured Light"

We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.” ― Christopher Hitchens, God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"
"“[Y]ou have to stop loving and pursuing Christ in order to sin. When you are pursuing love, running toward Christ, you do not have opportunity to wonder, *Am I doing this right?* or *Did I serve enough this week?* When you are running toward Christ, you are freed up to serve, love, and give thanks without guilt, worry or fear.

"“Reason excludes faith,"" Alessandro responded, watching the blood-red mite as it made a dash for the rim. ""It's deliberately limited. It won't function with the materials of religion. You can come close to proving the existence of God by reason, but you can't do it absolutely. That's because you can't do anything absolutely by reason. That's because reason depends on postulates. Postulates defy proof and yet they are essential to reason. God is a postulate. I don't think God is interested in the verification of His existence, and, therefore, neither am I. Anyway, I have professional reasons to believe. Nature and art pivot faithfully around God. Even dogs know that.” ― Mark Helprin"

"“Faith is a cop-out. If the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith, then you are conceding that it can't be taken on its own merits. It is intellectual bankruptcy.” ― Dan Barker, Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist"
"“if someone has just hurt you or broken your heart, if someone has just died, all the grace you need is there-waiting for you to receive it.

"“Our forgiving love toward men is the evidence of God's forgiving love in us. It is a necessary condition of the prayer of faith.” ― Andrew Murray, With Christ in the School of Prayer"
"“Why did they believe? Because they saw miracles. Things one man took as chance, a man of faith took as a sign. A loved one recovering from disease, a fortunate business deal, a chance meeting with a long lost friend. It wasn't the grand doctrines or the sweeping ideals that seemed to make believers out of men. It was the simple magic in the world around them.” ― Brandon Sanderson, The Hero of Ages"
"“Does trust have to be earned. Or is it simply a matter of faith?” ― Nicholas Sparks, At First Sight"
"“They say time is money, but that's not true. Time is life.

"“يبدو اننا جميعا بحاجة كي نؤمن بأحد ما أو شيء ما. فالحياة دون معنى او اتجاه بائسة حقا. ويبدوانه يتوجب ان نحيا من اجل هدف او شيء ما عزيز علينا ونموت من اجله، سواء كان هذا الهدف او الشيء مبدأ سياسي او خطة حياتية او أمة اوحلما او فكرة او مالا او اسرة. اعتقد ان التقديس هو جبلة في الانسان، وأن قدرنا هو أن نكون عبيدا سواء شئنا ذلك ام ابينا.” ― Jeffrey Lang, Even Angels Ask: A Journey to Islam in America"
"“A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment...For imagination sets the goal ‘picture’ which our automatic mechanism works on.

"“The opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty. Certainty is missing the point entirely. Faith includes noticing the mess, the emptiness and discomfort, and letting it be there until some light returns. Faith also means reaching deeply within, for the sense one was born with, the sense, for example, to go for a walk.” ― Anne Lamott, Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith"

From grief over the warm and ardent love which she had lost and still secretly mourned; from anguished joy over the pale, luminous love which drew her to the farthest boundaries of life on this earth. Through the great darkness that would come, she saw the gleam of another, gentler sun, and she sensed the fragrance of the herbs in the garden at world's end.” ― Sigrid Undset, The Wife"
"“My friend Adele describes fundamentalism as holding so tightly to your beliefs that your fingernails leave imprints on the palm of your hand... I think she's right. I was a fundamentalist not because of the beliefs I held but because of how I held them: with a death grip. It would take God himself to finally pry them out of my hands.

"“Sometimes you are in the middle of your destiny before you even know it has begun.” ― Sarah Holman"
"“I’m not sure what made me think God would choose to reveal himself to little ol’ me. I think I believed that if I pleaded often and hard enough, he would see how sincere I was and grant my request, kind of like Linus and the Great Pumpkin. My sincerity would win him over so he would choose my pumpkin patch -- or, in this case, my bedroom -- to make a brief personal appearance. Unfortunately, that never happened.” ― Spencer C Demetros, The Bible: Enter Here: Bringing God's Word to Life for Today's Teens"
"“What the hell are you getting so upset about?"" he asked her bewilderedly in a tone of contrite amusement. ""I thought you didn't believe in God.""""I don't,"" she sobbed, bursting violently into tears. ""But the God I don't believe in is a good God, a just God, a merciful God. He's not the mean and stupid God you make Him out to be.” ― Joseph Heller, Catch-22"
"“Because salvation is by grace through faith, I believe that among the countless number of people standing in front of the throne and in front of the Lamb, dressed in white robes and holding palms in their hands (see Revelation 7:9), I shall see the prostitute from the Kit-Kat Ranch in Carson City, Nevada, who tearfully told me that she could find no other employment to support her two-year-old son. I shall see the woman who had an abortion and is haunted by guilt and remorse but did the best she could faced with grueling alternatives; the businessman besieged with debt who sold his integrity in a series of desperate transactions; the insecure clergyman addicted to being liked, who never challenged his people from the pulpit and longed for unconditional love; the sexually abused teen molested by his father and now selling his body on the street, who, as he falls asleep each night after his last 'trick', whispers the name of the unknown God he learned about in Sunday school.'But how?' we ask.Then the voice says, 'They have washed their robes and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'There they are. There *we* are - the multitude who so wanted to be faithful, who at times got defeated, soiled by life, and bested by trials, wearing the bloodied garments of life's tribulations, but through it all clung to faith. My friends, if this is not good news to you, you have never understood the gospel of grace.” ― Brennan Manning, The Ragamuffin Gospel"
"“Hearts rebuilt from hope resurrect dreams killed by hate.” ― Aberjhani, The River of Winged Dreams"
"“Your faith will not fail while God sustains it; you are not strong enough to fall away while God is resolved to hold you.” ― J.I. Packer, Knowing God"
"“To ignore, repress, or dismiss our feelings is to fail to listen to the stirrings of the Spirit within our emotional life. Jesus listened. In John's Gospel we are told that Jesus was moved with the deepest emotions (11:33)... The gospel portrait of the beloved Child of Abba is that of a man exquisitely attuned to His emotions and uninhibited in expressing them. The Son of Man did not scorn of reject feelings as fickle and unreliable. They were sensitive antennae to which He listened carefully and through which He perceived the will of His Father for congruent speech and action.” ― Brennan Manning, Abba's Child: The Cry of the Heart for Intimate Belonging"

"“Faith is not a blind thing; for faith begins with knowledge. It is not a speculative thing; for faith believes facts of which it is sure. It is not an unpractical, dreamy thing; for faith trusts, and stakes its destiny upon the truth of revelation.” ― Charles H. Spurgeon, All of grace"
"“I show my scars so that others know they can heal.” ― Rhachelle Nicol', Sunday Mourning"
"“Too much faith is the worst ally. When you believe in something literally, through your faith you'll turn it into something absurd. One who is a genuine adherent, if you like, of some political outlook, never takes its sophistries seriously, but only its practical aims, which are concealed beneath these sophistries. Political rhetoric and sophistries do not exist, after all, in order that they be believed; rather, they have to serve as a common and agreed upon alibi. Foolish people who take them in earnest sooner or later discover inconsistencies in them, begin to protest, and finish finally and infamously as heretics and apostates. No, too much faith never brings anything good...” ― Milan Kundera"
"“Solitude is used to teach us how to live with other people. Rage is used to show us the infinite value of peace. Boredom is used to underline the importance of adventure & spontaneity. Silence is used to teach us to use words responsibly. Tiredness is used so that we can understand the value of waking up. Illness is used to underline the blessing of good health. Fire is used to teach us about water. Earth is used so that we can understand the value of air. Death is used to show us the importance of life.” ― Paulo Coelho, Warrior of the Light"
"“In her way, she was a hard one. Faith in any sort of natural justice was nothing but a night light; she knew of that. Whatever she did, she would end the same way with everyone does: flat on her back with a tube in her nose, wondering, ""Is this all?” ― Thomas Harris, Red Dragon"

"“We worship…the powers that speak to our souls, if it seems they do. We do so knowing there is more to the world, and the half-world, and perhaps worlds beyond, than we can grasp. We always knew that. We can’t even stop children from dying, how would we presume to understand the truth of things? Behind things? Does the presence of one power deny another?

"“And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.” ― Thomas Jefferson"

"“Faith is like love: it does not let itself be forced.” ― Arthur Schopenhauer"
"“As we come to grips with our own selfishness and stupidity, we make friends with the impostor and accept that we are impoverished and broken and realize that, if we were not, we would be God.

"“Anyone who is having troubles should pray. Anyone who is happy should sing praises. Anyone who is sick should call the church's elders. They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord. And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will heal that person. And if the person has sinned, the sins will be forgiven. Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen. (James 5:13-16)” ― Anonymous, The Holy Bible: King James Version"
"“Mr. Langdon, I did not ask if you believe what man says about God. I asked if you believed in God. There is a difference. Holy scripture is stories...legends and history of man's quest to understand his own need for meaning. I am not asking you to pass judgment on literature. I am asking if you believe in God. When you lie out under the stars, do you sense the divine? Do you feel in your gut that you are staring up at the work of God's hands?” ― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons"

"“It is argued that because they believed thoroughly in a just, moral God they could put there faith there and let the smaller insecurities take care of themselves. But I think that because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals, because they knew beyond doubt that they were valuable and potential moral units- because of this they could give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back. Such things have disappeared perhaps because men do not trust themselves anymore, and when that happens there is nothing left except perhaps to find some strong sure man, even though he may be wrong, and to dangle from his coat-tails.” ― John Steinbeck, East of Eden"

"“In all important transactions of life we have to take a leap in the dark.... If we decide to leave the riddles unanswered, that is a choice; if we waver in our answer, that, too, is a choice: but whatever choice we make, we make it at our peril. If a man chooses to turn his back altogether on God and the future, no one can prevent him; no one can show beyond reasonable doubt that he is mistaken. If a man thinks otherwise and acts as he thinks, I do not see that any one can prove that he is mistaken. Each must act as he thinks best; and if he is wrong, so much the worse for him. We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and blinding mist through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which may be deceptive. If we stand still we shall be frozen to death. If we take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces. We do not certainly know whether there is any right one. What must we do? ' Be strong and of a good courage.' Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes. . . . If death ends all, we cannot meet death better.” ― James Fitzjames Stephen, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity"
"“Devotion is diligence without assurance. Faith is a way of saying, 'Yes, I pre-accept the terms of the universe and I am voicing in advance what I am presently incapable of understanding.' There is a reason that we refer to leaps-of-faith, because the decision to consent to any notion of divinity is a mighty jump from the rational over to the unknowable, and I don't care how diligently scholars of every religion will try to sit you down with their stacks of books and prove that their faith is rational; it isn't. If they were rational, it wouldn't be - by definition - faith. Faith is belief in what you cannot see or prove or touch. Faith is walking face first and full speed into the dark.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love"
"“He had in those days imagined himself capable of extraordinary heroisms and endurances which would make the girl he loved forget the awkward hands and the spotty chin of adolescence. Everything had seemed possible. One could laugh at daydreams, but so long as you had the capacity to daydream there was a chance that you might develop some of the qualities of which you dreamed. It was like the religious discipline: words however emptily repeated can in time form a habit, a kind of unnoticed sediment at the bottom of the mind, until one day to your own surprise you find yourself acting on the belief you thought you didn't believe in.” ― Graham Greene, The Ministry of Fear"
"“Faith gives you an inner strength and a sense of balance and perspective in life.” ― Gregory Peck"
"“If the Sun and Moon should ever doubt, they'd immediately go out.” ― William Blake"
"“I've always been bad. Probably I shall be bad again, punished again. But the worse I am, the more I need God. I can't shut myself out from His mercy. ... Or it may be a private bargain between me and God, that if I give up this one thing I want so much, however bad I am, He won't quite despair of me in the end.” ― Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead Revisited"
"“The sorrow of God lies in our fear of Him, our fear of life, and our fear of ourselves. He anguishes over our self-absorption and self-sufficiency... God's sorrow lies in our refusal to approach Him when we sinned and failed.” ― Brennan Manning, Abba's Child: The Cry of the Heart for Intimate Belonging"
"“No one could really hate a saint, could they? They can't really hate God either. When they want to Hate Him and His saints they have to find something like themselves and pretends it's God and hate that.” ― Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder"
"“They said that I should lose my ideals and begin to believe in the methods of practical politicians. Now, I have not lost my ideals in the least; my faith in fundamentals is exactly what it always was. What I have lost is my childlike faith in practical politics.” ― G.K. Chesterton"
"“It is not easy to convey a sense of wonder, let alone resurrection wonder, to another. It’s the very nature of wonder to catch us off guard, to circumvent expectations and assumptions. Wonder can’t be packaged, and it can’t be worked up. It requires some sense of being there and some sense of engagement.” ― Eugene H. Peterson"

"“The nature of the enemy's warfare in your life is to cause you to become discouraged and to cast away your confidence.

"“I asked myself what I believed. I had never prayed a lot. I hoped hard, wished hard, but I didn't pray. I had developed a certain distrust of organised religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs. Quite simply, I believed I had a responsibility to be a good person, and that meant fair, honest, hardworking and honorable. If I did that, if I was good to my family, true to my friends, if I gave back to my community or to some cause, if I wasn't a liar, a cheat, or a thief, then I believed that should be enough. At the end of the day, if there was indeed some Body or presence standing there to judge me, I hoped I would be judged on whether I had lived a true life, not on whether I believed in a certain book, or whether I'd been baptised.” ― Lance Armstrong, It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life"

"“To my mind, faith is like being in the sun. When you are in the sun, can you avoid creating a shadow? Can you shake that area of darkness that clings to you, always shaped like you, as if constantly to remind you of yourself? You can’t. This shadow is doubt. And it goes wherever you go as long as you stay in the sun. And who wouldn’t want to be in the sun?” ― Yann Martel, Beatrice and Virgil"

"“We are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. We did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over ourselves. We are not our own masters. We are God's property. Is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? Is it any happiness or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? It may be thought so by the young and prosperous. These may think it a great thing to have everything, as they suppose, their own way–to depend on no one–to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of continual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. But as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that independence was not made for man–that it is an unnatural state–will do for a while, but will not carry us on safely to the end …'"" Mustapha Mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. ""Take this, for example,"" he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: ""'A man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of discomfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. Vain imaginings! That sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. They say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. But my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop because, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon God emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false–a reality, an absolute and everlasting truth. Yes, we inevitably turn to God; for this religious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.” ― Aldous Huxley, Brave New World"

"“I'm not a Wiccan. I'm not big on churches of any kind, despite the fact that I've spoken, face-to-face, with an archangel of the Almighty.But there were some things I believed in. Some things I had faith in. And faith isn't about perfect attendance to services, or how much money you put on the little plate. It isn't about going skyclad to the Holy Rites, or meditating each day upon the divine.Faith is about what you do. It's about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are. It's about making sacrifices for the good of others--even when there's not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are.Faith is a power of its own, and one even more elusive and difficult to define than magic.” ― Jim Butcher, Changes"

"“The test of faith is whether I can make space for difference. Can I recognize God's image in someone who is not in my image, who language, faith, ideal, are different from mine?

"“Omnipotent-benevolent simply means that God is all-powerful and well-meaning.''I understand the concept. It's just . . . there seems to be a contradiction.''Yes. The contradiction is pain. Man's starvation, war, sickness . . .''Exactly!' Chartrand knew the camerlengo would understand. 'Terrible things happen in this world. Human tragedy seems like proof that God could not possibly be both all-powerful and well-meaning. If He loves us and has the power to change our situation, He would prevent our pain, wouldn't He?'The camerlengo frowned. 'Would He?'Chartrand felt uneasy. Had he overstepped his bounds? Was this one of those religious questions you just didn't ask? 'Well . . . if God loves us, and He can protect us, He would have to. It seems He is either omnipotent and uncaring, or benevolent and powerless to help.''Do you have children, Lieutenant?'Chartrand flushed. 'No, signore.''Imagine you had an eight-year-old son . . . would you love him?''Of course.''Would you let him skateboard?'Chartrand did a double take. The camerlengo always seemed oddly ""in touch"" for a clergyman. 'Yeah, I guess,' Chartrand said. 'Sure, I'd let him skateboard, but I'd tell him to be careful.''So as this child's father, you would give him some basic, good advice and then let him go off and make his own mistakes?''I wouldn't run behind him and mollycoddle him if that's what you mean.''But what if he fell and skinned his knee?''He would learn to be more careful.'The camerlengo smiled. 'So although you have the power to interfere and prevent your child's pain, you would choose to show your love by letting him learn his own lessons?''Of course. Pain is part of growing up. It's how we learn.'The camerlengo nodded. 'Exactly.” ― Dan Brown, Angels & Demons"

"“Faith, hope and charity go together. Hope is practised through the virtue of patience, which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that, as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points out, in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light—and in the end, the only light—that can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God. To experience love and in this way to cause the light of God to enter into the world—this is the invitation I would like to extend with the present Encyclical.” ― Pope Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger), God is Love: Deus Caritas Est"
"“A family in my sister's neighborhood was recently stricken with a double tragedy, when both the young mother and her three-year-old son were diagnosed with cancer. When Catherine told me about this, I could only say, shocked, ""Dear God, that family needs grace.""

I do not know if my sister fully recognizes that this IS grace.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love"

"“Concerning the Gods, there are those who deny the very existence of the Godhead; others say that it exists, but neither bestirs nor concerns itself not has forethought far anything. A third party attribute to it existence and forethought, but only for great and heavenly matters, not for anything that is on earth. A fourth party admit things on earth as well as in heaven, but only in general, and not with respect to each individual.

"“Life no argument. - We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we can live - by positing bodies, lines, planes, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content; without these articles of faith nobody now could endure life.

"“The organist was almost at the end of the anthem’s long introduction, and as the crescendo increases the cathedral began to glitter before my eyes until I felt as if every stone in the building was vibrating in anticipation of the sweeping sword of sound from the Choir.The note exploded in our midst, and at that moment I knew our creator had touched not only me but all of us, just as Harriet had touched that sculpture with a loving hand long ago, and in that touch I sensed the indestructible fidelity, the indescribable devotion and the inexhaustible energy of the creator as he shaped his creation, bringing life out of dead matter, wresting form continually from chaos. Nothing was ever lost, Harriet had said, and nothing was ever wasted because always, when the work was finally completed, every article of the created process, seen or unseen, kept or discarded, broken or mended – EVERYTHING was justified, glorified and redeemed.” ― Susan Howatch"

"“When you let go of control and commit yourself to happiness, it is so easy to offer compassion and forgiveness. This propels you from the past, into the present. People that are negative, spend so much time trying to control situations and blame others for their problems.

"“But what of faith? What of fidelity and loyalty? Complete trust? Faith is not granted by tangible proof. It comes from the heart and the soul.

Eric, who was going through a religious phase at the time which I suppose I was to some extent copying, thought this was a terrible thing to say; God wasn't like that. I said the one I believed in was.” ― Iain Banks, The Wasp Factory"
"“If, in the quiet of your heart, you feel something should be done, stop and consider whether it is in line with the character and teaching of Jesus. If so, obey that impulse to do it, and in doing so you will find it was God guiding you.” ― Eric Liddell"
"“Pico Iyer: “And at some point, I thought, well, I’ve been really lucky to see many, many places. Now, the great adventure is the inner world, now that I’ve spent a lot of time gathering emotions, impressions, and experiences. Now, I just want to sit still for years on end, really, charting that inner landscape because I think anybody who travels knows that you’re not really doing so in order to move around—you’re traveling in order to be moved. And really what you’re seeing is not just the Grand Canyon or the Great Wall but some moods or intimations or places inside yourself that you never ordinarily see when you’re sleepwalking through your daily life. I thought, there’s this great undiscovered terrain that Henry David Thoreau and Thomas Merton and Emily Dickinson fearlessly investigated, and I want to follow in their footsteps.” ― Krista Tippett, Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living"
"“I'm only a tool, beloved. Not your Savior” ― Francine Rivers, Redeeming Love"
"“We live by revelation, as Christians, as artists, which means we must be careful never to get set into rigid molds. The minute we begin to think we know all the answers, we forget the questions, and we become smug like the Pharisee who listed all his considerable virtues, and thanked God that he was not like other men.Unamuno might be describing the artist as well as the Christian as he writes, ""Those who believe they believe in God, but without passion in the heart, without anguish of mind, without uncertainty, without doubt, and even at times without despair, believe only in the idea of God, and not in God himself.” ― Madeleine L'Engle, Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art"
"“Science only goes so far, then comes God.- Noah Calhoun-” ― Nicholas Sparks, The Notebook"
"“We don't look at the stars in the universe and say how tragic they are, how bruised they are, even though that is what they are. We look at them and speak of the beauty they contain. The inspiration they give us. Even though stars are the scars of the universe we don't see them as these broken pieces of gaseous matter, we see them as these majestic astrological blessings that give hope to billions. What if you saw yourself in that same light, or better yet what if you saw others in a similar way.” ― Ricky Maye, Barefoot Christianity"
"“We all go through hard times in life. It’s a part of being alive and it's the reality we all have to deal with. There are times we forget our value as a person because we are so blinded with these thoughts of loneliness, emptiness and ego. Somewhere along the road we become numbed with all the frustrations and dissatisfaction. But life itself isn't always about darkness and sadness, Life is also filled with colors and that makes it beautiful. Along this path of darkness there's always light waiting to be seen by our daunted hearts. Our heart is gifted to see this light. It may be hiding behind those circumstances that we encounter; in a stranger we just met at an unexpected place; a family who has been always there but you just ignored because of your imperfect relationship with them; it might be a long time friend you have or a friend you just met. Open your heart and you will see how blessed you are to have them all in your life. Sometimes they are the light that shines your path in some dark phases of life. Don't lose hope” ― Chanda Kaushik"

"“And now we step to the rhythm of miracles.--from The Light, That Never Dies” ― Aberjhani, Elemental: The Power of Illuminated Love"
"“Well, see, I think it's that most people don't like that lonely feeling. People don't like looking up and feeling small or lost. That's what I think prayer is all about. It doesn't matter which stories they believe in, they're all doing the same thing, kind of casting a line out to outer space, like there's something out there to connect to. It's like people make themselves part of something bigger that way, and maybe it makes them less afraid.” ― Craig Silvey, Jasper Jones"
"“My faith has been tempered in Hell. My faith has emerged from the flames of the crematoria, from the concrete of the gas chamber. I have seen that it is not man who is impotent in the struggle against evil, but the power of evil that is impotent in the struggle against man. The powerlessness of kindness, of senseless kindness, is the secret of its immortality. It can never be conquered. The more stupid, the more senseless, the more helpless it may seem, the vaster it is. Evil is impotent before it. The prophets, religious teachers, reformers, social and political leaders are impotent before it. This dumb, blind love is man's meaning.Human history is not the battle of good struggling to overcome evil. It is a battle fought by a great evil struggling to crush a small kernel of human kindness. But if what is human in human beings has not been destroyed even now, then evil will never conquer.” ― Vasily Grossman, Life and Fate"
"“Now how can anybody look at that and not believe in God? I mean, how can anybody look at this and not believe there is some higher power, some divine force at work in the universe greater than Man, some god that created it, that created all this, that created us?” ― Katharine Hepburn"
"“God wants to dance with us. The goal of dancing is NOT to learn the steps. The goal of dancing is to enjoy your partner. We learn the steps but only so we don't have to look down at our feet.

"“All was in God's plan, and he had to accept even as he didn't understand.” ― Barbara Cameron, A Time to Love"

"“All right, God, say that You are really there. You have put me in this fix. You want to test me. Suppose I test You? Suppose I say that You are not there? You've given me a supreme test with my parents and with these boils. I think that I have passed Your test. I am tougher than You. If You will come down here right now, I will spit into Your face, if You have a face. And do You shit? The priest never answered that question. He told us not to doubt. Doubt what? I think that You have been picking on me too much so I am asking You to come down here so I can put You to the test! I waited. Nothing. I waited for God. I waited and waited. I believe I slept.” ― Charles Bukowski, Ham on Rye"
"“Their lives were violent, precarious, fragile, but they fought for them anyway, and held to the hope that their brief stay on this earth might count for something. That faith was worth preserving.” ― Leigh Bardugo, Wonder Woman: Warbringer"

"“Faith can move mountains. So why are you stumbling on a little rock?” ― Jonathan Nettles"
"“On the subject of who is to blame for our disunity - “The easy conclusion- thatthe devil is at work trying to destroy the church- is true, but itʼs not the whole story. Ofcourse the enemy is at work doing that. But closer examination shows that much ofthe blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the church itself-on believers in god-andhow our own devilish deeds have alienated other followers of God. Sadly, weʼve donethe devilʼs work for him.” ― Ed Galisewski"

"“Interestingly, God's remedy for Elijah's depression was not a refresher course in theology but food and sleep... Before God spoke to him at all, Elijah was fed twice and given a good chance to sleep. Only then, and very gently, did God confront him with his error. This is always God's way. Having made us as human beings, He respects our humanness and treats us with integrity. That is, He treats us true to the truth of who we are. It is human beings and not God who have made spirituality impractical.” ― Os Guinness, God in the Dark: The Assurance of Faith Beyond a Shadow of Doubt"
"“We are not sheep or cows. God didn’t create fences for us or boundaries to contain our nationalities. Man did. God didn’t draw up religious barriers to separate us from each other. Man did. And on top of that, no father would like to see his children fighting or killing each other. The Creator favors the man who spreads loves over the man who spreads hate. A religious title does not make anyone more superior over another. If a kind man stands by his conscience and exhibits truth in his words and actions, he will stand by God regardless of his faith. If mankind wants to evolve, we must learn from our past mistakes. If not, our technology will evolve without us.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“What is seen is not the TruthWhat is cannot be saidTrust comes not without seeingNor understanding without wordsThe wise comprehends with knowledgeTo the ignorant it is but a wonderSome worship the formless GodSome worship his various formsIn what way He is beyond these attributesOnly the Knower knowsThat music cannot be writtenHow can then be the notesSay Kabir, awareness alone will overcome illusion.” ― Kabir"

"“Holiness is the strength of the soul. It comes by faith and through obedience to God's laws and ordinances. God then purifies the heart by faith, and the heart becomes purged from that which is profane and unworthy. When holiness is achieved by conforming to God's will, one knows intuitively that which is wrong and that which is right before the Lord. Holiness speaks when there is silence, encouraging that which is good or reproving that which is wrong.” ― James E. Faust"
"“My faith in the expertise of physicists like Richard Feynman, for instance, permits me to endorse—and, if it comes to it, bet heavily on the truth of—a proposition that I don't understand. So far, my faith is not unlike religious faith, but I am not in the slightest bit motivated to go to my death rather than recant the formulas of physics. Watch: E doesn't equal mc2, it doesn't, it doesn't! I was lying, so there!” ― Daniel C. Dennett, Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon"

"“If you hold a candle close to you, its flame rises. And if you hold it away from you, its flame shrinks. The same way you hold a candle close to you, keep all your plans, aspirations, projects, and dreams close to you too. Do not share your plans or goals until you complete them, because as you hold your candle away from you, your goals will shrink in the eyes of others. Envy, jealousy, and resentment will put out your flame before it grows.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“The problem that we are facing in the church today is that we have so many Christians who have made a decision to believe in Jesus but not a commitment to follow Him. We have people who are planning to, meaning to, trying to, wanting to, going to, we just don't have people who are doing it.” ― Tyler Edwards, Zombie Church: Breathing Life Back into the Body of Christ"
"“Why do some persons 'find' God in a way that others do not? Why does God manifest His Presence to some and let multitudes of others struggle along in the half-light of imperfect Christian experience? Of course the will of God is the same for all. He has no favorites within His household. All He has ever done for any of His children He will do for all of His children. The difference lies not with God but with us.” ― A.W. Tozer, The Pursuit of God: The Human Thirst for the Divine"

"“God seemed to have become a brand, a packaging, and people purchase this trusted brand with such faith and devotion that they no longer care who the vendor is.” ― Justin Villanueva, Conversations with the Light Bearer"
"“We can say that true gratitude does not give rise to the debtor's ethic because it gives rise to faith in future grace. With true gratitude there is such a delight in the worth of God's past grace, that we are driven on to experience more and more of it in the future...it is done by transforming gratitude into faith as it turns from contemplating the pleasures of past grace and starts contemplating the promises of the future. ” ― John Piper"

"“You are entitled to know that two entities occupy your body. One of these entities is motivated by and responds to the impulse of fear.

Will you be guided by faith or will you allow fear to overtake you?” ― Napoleon Hill, Outwitting the Devil: The Secret to Freedom and Success"
"“I believe in God the way I believe in quarks. People whose business it is to know about quantum physics or religion tell me they have good reason to believe that quarks and God exist. And they tell me that if I wanted to devote my life to learning what they've learned, I'd find quarks and God just like they did.” ― Mary Doria Russell, The Sparrow"

"“I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are led by him.

"“Guidance, like all God's acts of blessing under the covenant of grace, is a sovereign act. Not merely does God will to guide us in the sense of showing us his way, that we may tread it; he wills also to guide us in the more fundamental sense of ensuring that, whatever happens, whatever mistakes we may make, we shall come safely home. Slippings and strayings there will be, no doubt, but the everlasting arms are beneath us; we shall be caught, rescued, restored. This is God's promise; this is how good he is.” ― J.I.

Faith means going forward by whatever means we can.” ― Julia Cameron, Finding Water: The Art of Perseverance"

"“People unable to bear the martyrdom [...] unintelligently jump off the path, and choose instead, conveniently enough, the world’s admiration of their proficiency. The true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher, and in this lies the deep humanity in him which is more worth than this foolish concern for others’ weal and woe which is honoured under the name of sympathy, but which is really nothing but vanity.” ― Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling"
"“I often ask myself, 'Who would Jesus vote for?' Then I start to think that he wouldn't vote at all; however, it would not be out of apathy or disinterest, but out of perfection and light. As a miracle worker, I think he would, by the power of God's teachings, the perseverance and the truth, influence in a modern sense whoever is put into office how to best serve his fellow men. One, like his skeptics, may find that impractical. But there is a message in that no man in power can slow the momentum of the will of God, and the miracles of his teachings will be forever victorious.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"

"“Faith is the acknowledgment of the entire absence of all goodness in us, and the recognition of the cross as the substitute for all the want on our part. Faith saves, because it owns the complete salvation of another, and not because it contributes anything to that salvation.” ― Horatius Bonar, The Everlasting Righteousness"

"“It isn't for the moment you are struck that you need courage, but for that long uphill climb back to sanity and faith and security.” ― Anne Morrow Lindbergh"
"“It is hard to see how a great man can be an atheist. Without the sustaining influence of faith in a divine power we could have little faith in ourselves. We need to feel that behind us is intelligence and love. Doubters do not achieve; skeptics do not contribute; cynics do not create. Faith is the great motive power, and no man realizes his full possibilities unless he has the deep conviction that life is eternally important, and that his work, well done, is a part of an unending plan.” ― Calvin Coolidge"
"“Honey, nobody ever knows someone completely. You have to just enjoy what you do know and have faith in the rest.” ― Erin McCarthy, Hard and Fast"
"“Some people say they will not believe in anything they can't see. What a catastrophe to not have any faith at all! You live only less than a half of life, if you will only believe in the things that you can see. Life is lived by those who have much faith and believe in many unseen things. If you believe in nothing that you cannot see, think about how much there is that you choose to turn your face away from! You can't see your soul and you cannot prove that it exists, therefore if you call yourself one who believes in nothing unseen, then you will forever deny your soul its existence, for the existence of the soul dwells in love, trust, anger, passion, faith, belief, strength; the soul is forever nourished by things that are unseen! And so we have too many empty bodies walking around! Bodies with souls inside that are half-dead and dying.” ― C. JoyBell C."

"“In God's eyes, a man who teaches one truth and nothing else is more righteous than a man who teaches a million truths and one lie.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“We are not asked to SEE,"" said Amy. ""Why need we when we KNOW?"" We know--not the answer to the inevitable Why, but the incontestable fact that it is for the best.

"“The question the doubter does not ask is whether faith was really useless or simply not used. What would you think of a boy who gave up learning to ride a bicycle, complaining that he hurt himself because his bicycle stopped moving so he had no choice but to fall off? If he wanted to sit comfortably while remaining stationary, he should not have chosen a bicycle but a chair. Similarly faith must be put to use, or it will become useless.” ― Os Guinness, God in the Dark: The Assurance of Faith Beyond a Shadow of Doubt"

"“Orthodoxy is idolatry if it means holding the 'correct opinions about God' - 'fundamentalism' is the most extreme and salient example of such idolatry - but not if it means holding faith in the right way, that is, not holding it at all but being held by God, in love and service. Theology is idolatry if it means what we say about God instead of letting ourselves be addressed by what God has to say to us. Faith is idolatrous if it is rigidly self-certain but not if it is softened in the waters of 'doubt.” ― John D. Caputo, What Would Jesus Deconstruct?: The Good News of Postmodernism for the Church"

We hear what we want to hear and accept what we want to accept, for the most part, simply because there is nothing more offensive than feeling like you have to re-evaluate your own train of thought and purpose in life. You have to die to an extent in your hunger for faith, for wisdom, and quite frankly, most people aren't ready to die.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“Your faith was strong, but you needed proof...” ― Leonard Cohen"
"“Peaceful disputes are maintained when men sincerely believe that they are morally, logically correct about the issues at hand. It is when neither side is really certain that wars are instigated.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“Do not come into agreement with fear. Activate your faith, live in victory, speak over your life and expect great things to come your way.” ― Germany Kent"
"“It was just like him, she thought; with him, a happy ending was always a foregone conclusion. But such was the power of his faith that when she was with him; she found herself believing in happy endings, too.” ― Sharon Kay Penman, When Christ and His Saints Slept"
"“I have often noticed that these things, which obsess me, neither bother nor impress other people even slightly. I am horribly apt to approach some innocent at a gathering, and like the ancient mariner, fix him with a wild, glitt’ring eye and say, “Do you know that in the head of the caterpillar of the ordinary goat moth there are two hundred twenty-eight separate muscles?” The poor wretch flees. I am not making chatter; I mean to change his life.” ― Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"
"“Fatigue can make it hard to have faith. Too much busyness can make it hard to have faith. Too much of too little solitude can impact faith. For that matter, so can a bout of hunger or overwork, anything carried to an extreme. Faith thrives on routine. Look at any monastery and you will see that. Faith keeps on keeping on.” ― Julia Cameron, Finding Water: The Art of Perseverance"
"“I see it in your eyes as I see it in hers. Remember, there is always light where there is love and if that is what is meant to happen between the two of you, then it was destined.” ― L.G. Castillo, Lash"
"“There are some who are still weak in faith, who ought to be instructed, and who would gladly believe as we do. But their ignorance prevents them...we must bear patiently with these people and not use our liberty; since it brings to peril or harm to body or soul...but if we use our liberty unnecessarily, and deliberately cause offense to our neighbor, we drive away the very one who in time would come to our faith. Thus St. Paul circumcised Timothy (Acts 16:3) because simple minded Jews had taken offense; he thought: what harm can it do, since they are offended because of ignorance? But when, in Antioch, they insisted that he out and must circumcise Titus (Gal. 2:3) Paul withstood them all and to spite them refused to have Titus circumcised... He did the same when St. Peter...it happened in this way: when Peter was with the Gentiles he ate pork and sausages with them, but when the Jews came in, he abstained from this food and did not eat as he did before. Then the Gentiles who had become Christians though: Alas! we, too, must be like the Jews, eat no pork, and live according to the law of Moses. But when Paul learned that they were acting to the injury of evangelical freedom, he reproved Peter publicly and read him an apostolic lecture, saying: ""If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?"" (Gal. 2:14). Thus we, too, should order our lives and use our liberty at the proper time, so that Christian liberty may suffer no injury, and no offense be given to our weak brothers and sisters who are still without the knowledge of this liberty.” ― Martin Luther"
"“A disciple: I am worried about human suffering all over the world. What is the solution?Spiritual leader: The solution to our miseries lie within central atom of our being, ‘I’. Once this central atom transcends to ‘WE’, human sufferings can be resolved.” ― Santosh Kalwar, Quote Me Everyday"
"“As a general rule, Providence seldom vouchsafes to mortals any more than just that degree of encouragement which suffices to keep them at a reasonably full exertion of their powers.” ― Nathaniel Hawthorne, The House of the Seven Gables"
"“Each moment of worry, anxiety or stress represents lack of faith in miracles, for they never cease.” ― T.F. Hodge, From Within I Rise: Spiritual Triumph over Death and Conscious Encounters With the Divine Presence"
"“The primary purpose of prayer is not to make requests. The primary purpose is to praise, to sing, to chant. Because the essence of prayer is a song, and man cannot live without a song. Prayer may not save us. But prayer may make us worthy of being saved.” ― Abraham Joshua Heschel, Moral Grandeur and Spiritual Audacity"
"“A farmer is helpless to grow grain; all he can do is provide the right conditions for the growing of grain. He cultivates the ground, he plants the seed, he waters the plants, and then the natural forces of the earth take over and up comes the grain...This is the way it is with the Spiritual Disciplines - they are a way of sowing to the Spirit... By themselves the Spiritual Disciplines can do nothing; they can only get us to the place where something can be done.” ― Richard J. Foster, Celebration of Discipline: The Path to Spiritual Growth"
"“It is extremely important for you to believe in yourselves not only for what you are now but for what you have the power to become. Trust in the Lord as He leads you along. He has things for you to do that you won't know about now but that will unfold later. If you stay close to Him, You will have some great adventures. You will live in a time where instead of sometimes being fulfilled, many of them will actually be fulfilled. The Lord will unfold your future bit by bit.” ― Neal A. Maxwell"
"“But everything I have to give, I'll give to you” ― Ray Lamontagne"
"“The only thing that guarantees an open-ended collaboration among human beings, the only thing that guarantees that this project is truly open-ended, is a willingness to have our beliefs and behaviors modified by the power of conversation.” ― Sam Harris"
"“Maybe we are a little crazy. After all, we believe in things we don't see. The Scriptures say that faith is ""being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see"" (Heb. 11:1). We believe poverty can end even though it is all around us. We believe in peace even though we hear only rumours of wars. And since we are people of expectation, we are so convinced that another world is coming that we start living as if it were already here.” ― Shane Claiborne, The Irresistible Revolution: Living as an Ordinary Radical"

"“We need faith and the mind of the Lord Jesus to recognize something of lasting value in even our most ordinary tasks.” ― phillip yancey"
"“God doesn't expect us to be a walking encyclopedia of biblical knowledge. He wants us to know Him, to be in a relationship with Him. This means not only hearing but allowing our understanding of God to change the way we live. Like the wise builder who laid the foundation of his house on the rock, we learn to let our knowledge of God change us.” ― Tyler Edwards, Zombie Church: Breathing Life Back into the Body of Christ"
"“The lust of the flesh directs these desires [of personal union], however, to satisfaction of the body, often at the cost of a real and full communion of persons.” ― Pope John Paul II, Blessed are the pure of heart: Catechesis on the Sermon on the Mount and writings of St. Paul"
"“The paradox in Christian truth is invariably due to the fact that it is the truth that exists for God. The standard of measure and the end is superhuman; and there is only one relationship possible: faith.” ― Søren Kierkegaard"
"“(about William Blake)[Blake] said most of us mix up God and Satan. He said that what most people think is God is merely prudence, and the restrainer and inhibitor of energy, which results in fear and passivity and ""imaginative death.""And what we so often call ""reason"" and think is so fine, is not intelligence or understanding at all, but just this: it is arguing from our *memory* and the sensations of our body and from the warnings of other people, that if we do such and such a thing we will be uncomfortable. ""It won't pay."" ""People will think it is silly."" ""No one else does it."" ""It is immoral.""But the only way you can grow in understanding and discover whether a thing is good or bad, Blake says, is to do it. ""Sooner strangle an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires.""For this ""Reason"" as Blake calls it (which is really just caution) continually nips and punctures and shrivels the imagination and the ardor and the freedom and the passionate enthusiasm welling up in us. It is Satan, Blake said. It is the only enemy of God. ""For nothing is pleasing to God except the invention of beautiful and exalted things."" And when a prominent citizen of his time, a logical, opining, erudite, measured, rationalistic, Know-it-all, warned people against ""mere enthusiasm,"" Blake wrote furiously (he was a tender-hearted, violent and fierce red-haired man): ""Mere enthusiasm is the All in All!” ― Brenda Ueland, If You Want to Write: A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit"
"“practice only envisioning yourself at the finish line and be unrelenting and fervent in racing towards that finish line.

"“I couldn't care less about evidence and proof and assurances. I just want God. I want God inside me. I want God to play in my bloodstream the way sunlight amuses itself on water.” ― Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love"
"“The German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, who had syphilis, said that only a person of deep faith could afford the luxury of religious skepticism. Humanists, by and large educated, comfortably middle-class persons with rewarding lives like mine, find rapture enough in secular knowledge and hope. Most people can't.” ― Kurt Vonnegut, Timequake"
"“The vermin explain their sin with sanctimonious language like, ""We've prayed about it and sought counsel, and we feel it's the right thing to do."" Don't let it down on them that to the Enemy what they feel is inconsequential. His moral laws don't give a rip about how any of them feel. The sludgebags have no more power to vote them in and out of existence than they have power to revoke the law of gravity.” ― Randy Alcorn, Lord Foulgrin's Letters"

"“It is certain that an atom of goodness on the path of faith is never lost.” ― Rumi"
"“Trusting God's grace means trusting God's love for us rather than our love for God. […] Therefore our prayers should consist mainly of rousing our awareness of God's love for us rather than trying to rouse God's awareness of our love for him, like the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18:26-29).” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“While fear depletes power, faith gives wings for the soul’s elevation.” ― T.F. Hodge, From Within I Rise: Spiritual Triumph over Death and Conscious Encounters With the Divine Presence"
"“It [Communism] is not new. It is, in fact, man's second oldest faith. Its promise was whispered in the first days of the Creation under the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: ""Ye shall be as gods."" It is the great alternative faith of mankind. Like all great faiths, its force derives from a simple vision. Other ages have had great visions. They have always been different versions of the same vision: the vision of God and man's relationship to God. The Communist vision is the vision of Man without God.It is the vision of man's mind displacing God as the creative intelligence of the world. It is the vision of man's liberated mind, by the sole force of its rational intelligence, redirecting man's destiny and reorganizing man's life and the world. It is the vision of man, once more the central figure of the Creation, not because God made man in his image, but because man's mind makes him the most intelligent of the animals. Copernicus and his successors displaced man as the central fact of the universe by proving that the earth was not the central star of the universe. Communism restores man to his sovereignty by the simple method of denying God.” ― Whittaker Chambers, Witness"

"“The single most important piece of advice about prayer is one word: Begin!” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“When we find that God's ways always coincide with our own ways, it's time to question who we're really worshipping, God or ourselves. The latter moves the nature of godliness from the King to our servant to a slave, a deduction into the realm of selfhood and then the lower, slavehood. It's a spiritual mathematics in that men who need God in his godhood are humble yet strong and spiritually ambitious while men who need a slave in their selfhood are ultimately paralyzed and will remain paralyzed.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“What is false about hope?” ― Mitch Albom, The First Phone Call from Heaven"
"“It’s so easy to lose faith and become lost in all of the politics of the world. That’s why we need the arts. To sublimate our frustration and anger into something beautiful. Freud called sublimation a virtuous defence mechanism because it is in the arts that we can find our humanity.” ― Kamand Kojouri"
"“I believe in free will. I think we make our own decisions and carry out or own actions. And our actions have consequences. The world is what we make it. But I think sometimes we can ask God to help us and He will.” ― Michael Grant, Gone"

"“I will not join the rat race because I'm not a rat. And I will not blindly follow a specific faith because I'm not a bat. The only race I'll take part in is for humans being humane.

"“If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for? Isn't love hard to believe? Don't you bully me with your politeness! Love is hard to believe, ask any lover.

"“Doa yang tulus dan dengan cinta, adalah kekuatan besar yang bisa menyelamatkan siapa pun, termasuk orang yang mendoakannya.” ― Amanda Inez, Beauty Sleep"
"“What I admire about the modern atheist is not at all his logic, but rather his gift of imagination. There will always be the cartoon versions of Christianity further perpetuated by the extremist atheists who do not possess the humility to ask real scholars and theologians its difficult questions. There is little doubt that the atheist has the bigger imagination: the first reason is due to his persistent caricatures of what constitutes a Christian; the second because of his belief that most of his questions are actually rhetorical. From this I can infer that, instead of laughing at one another (the Christian at modern atheist immaturity and the modern atheist at Christian stupidity), we would have a better chance at productivity laughing with one another as we all dumb down what we don't understand.” ― Criss Jami, Healology"
"“A man of God would never burn or harm a temple of any kind - regardless of religion. A true man of God would see every temple or divine mansion built to glorify the Creator - as an extension of the temple closest to his home, regardless of its shape, size, or color. A man who truly recognizes and knows God can see God in all things.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“I'm always talking to God about whether or not he exists - that's how I know I'm a theist.” ― Criss Jami, Healology"
"“I guess that's where faith comes in, the faith of a child to believe in Santa, the faith of an adult to believe in God, maybe faith is what makes something real?

"“The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.--as quoted in THE RIVER OF WINGED DREAMS” ― Abraham Lincoln"
"“Men and women are needed whose prayers will give to the world the utmost power of God; who will make His promises to blossom with rich and full results. God is waiting to hear us and challenges us to bring Him to do this thing by our praying. He is asking us, to-day, as He did His ancient Israel, to prove Him now herewith."" Behind God's Word is God Himself, and we read: ""Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, his Maker: Ask of me of things to come and concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me."" As though God places Himself in the hands and at the disposal of His people who pray - as indeed He does. The dominant element of all praying is faith, that is conspicuous, cardinal and emphatic. Without such faith it is impossible to please God, and equally impossible to pray.” ― E.M. Bounds, The Weapon of Prayer"
"“You asked the Holy Spirit for a miracle, and now that you’ve got one you’re trying to argue it away. People who don’t believe in miracles shouldn’t pray for them.” ― David Wilkerson, The Cross and the Switchblade"

"“Self abandoned, relaxed and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, I felt the torrent come; to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.” ― Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre"
"“Every tomorrow has two handles. We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith.” ― Henry Ward Beecher"
"“The Latin words humus, soil/earth, and homo, human being, have a common derivation, from which we also get our word 'humble.' This is the Genesis origin of who we are: dust - dust that the Lord God used to make us a human being. If we cultivate a lively sense of our origin and nurture a sense of continuity with it, who knows, we may also acquire humility.” ― Eugene Peterson, Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places"
"“Although the far territory of the extreme can exert an intoxicating pull on susceptible individuals of all bents, extremism seems to be especially prevalent among those inclined by temperament or upbringing toward religious pursuits. Faith is the very antithesis of reason, injudiciousness a crucial component of spiritual devotion. And when religious fanaticism supplants ratiocination, all bets are suddenly off.” ― Jon Krakauer, Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith"
"“There are certain mortal moments and minutes that matter. Certain hingepoints in the history of each human. Some seconds are so decisive they shrink the soul, while others are spent, so as to stretch the soul.” ― Neal A. Maxwell"
"“This day is not a sieve, losing time. With each passing minute, each passing year, there's this deepening awareness that I am filling, gaining time. We stand on the brink of eternity.” ― Ann Voskamp, One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are"
"“What has happened to create this doubt is that a problem (such as a deep conflict or a bad experience) has been allowed to usurp God's place and become the controlling principle of life. Instead of viewing the problem from the vantage point of faith, the doubter views faith from the vantage point of the problem. Instead of faith sizing up the problem, the situation ends with the problem scaling down faith. The world of faith is upside down, and in the topsy-turvy reality of doubt, a problem has become god and God has become a problem.” ― OS Guiness"

"“As the essence of courage is to stake one's life on a possibility, so the essence of faith is to believe the possibility exists.” ― William Salter"
"“I've been a Christian since I was a little girl. But my Christianity is a muddy mess of thoughts and opinions and making God into what works for me-like going shopping at the mall and picking out whatever I want, putting together faith like I would an outfit. Somehow I don't think the Creator, the I AM, the savior of the world is something we can mix and match to out liking.” ― Cindy Martinusen-Coloma, Caleb + Kate"

"“You can get lost on your way home. You can get lost looking for love. You can get lost between jobs. You can get lost looking for God. However it happens, take heart. Others before you have found a way in the wilderness, where there are as many angels as there are wild beasts, and plenty of other lost people too. All it takes is one of them to find you. All it takes is you to find one of them. However it happens, you could do worse than to kneel down and ask a blessing, remembering how many knees have kissed this altar before you.” ― Barbara Brown Taylor"
"“Most reject the more repugnant or indefensible dogmas while still holding onto some core belief. Many believers will proudly describe themselves as ""reasonable"" or ""rational"" based on how little of their religion they still embrace versus how much they now reject. I think it's funny when people realize that the less you believe the more reasonable you are, but they stop before they reach the logical conclusion.” ― Aron Ra"
"“So as I shivered, naked and damp, in front of the bathroom mirror, I raised my eyes skyward. ""I hope we're still okay.""I got no answer, but then, I didn't really expect one. Answer or not, it didn't matter. That's the thing about faith, I guess.” ― Chloe Neill"

"“If the Creator stood before a million men with the light of a million lamps, only a few would truly see him because truth is already alive in their hearts. Truth can only be seen by those with truth in them. He who does not have Truth in his heart, will always be blind to it.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“Reading a book about something can be an obstacle to doing it because it gives you the impression that you are doing what you are only thinking about doing. It is tempting to remain in the comfortable theater of our imagination instead of the real world, to fall in love with the idea of becoming a saint and loving God and neighbor instead of doing the actual work, because the idea makes no demands on you. It is like a book on a shelf. But, as Dostoyevsky says, 'love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams' (The Brothers Karamazov).” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“those who have loved are those that have found God” ― Guru Nanak"

"“The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, When Allah loves a people, He tries them.” ― Leila Aboulela , Lyrics Alley"
"“Realizing the seriously ruthless, venomous habits and agendas of evil always instills a more fierce passion and longing for a closer God. Men, out of pride, may claim their own authorities over what constitutes good and evil; they may self-proclaim a keen knowledge of subjective morality through religion or science. But that is only if they are acknowledging the work of evil as a cartoon-like, petty little rain cloud in the sky that merely wants to dampen one's spirits. On the contrary, a man could be without a doubt lit with the strength, the peace, and the knowledge of the gods, his gods, but when or if the devils grow weary in unsuccessful attempts to torment him, they begin tormenting his loved ones, or, if not his loved ones, anyone who may attempt to grasp his philosophies. No matter how godly he may become, God is, in the end, his only hope and his only grace for the pressures built around him - it is left up to a higher authority and a more solid peace and a wider love to eclipse not just one's own evils but all evils for goodness to ultimately matter. If all men were gods, each being would dwell in a separate prison cell, hopeless, before finally imploding into nothingness.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“I can't make those two realities -- what I've lost and what I've found -- fit together in some tidy pattern of divine causality. I just have to hold them on the one hand and on the other, just like that.” ― Kate Braestrup, Here If You Need Me"

"“Спомням си как през летните следобеди, които прекарвах там, баба ми, привършила домашната работа, сядаше до прозореца на светло и вадеше от своя скришен сандък една огромна Библия с твърди корици, обвита с тогавашния официозен вестник ""Работническо дело"" по конспиративни причини. Вече знаех, че комунизмът и Библията никак не се обичаха.” ― Георги Господинов, Невидимите кризи"
"“We try too much and trust too little. Count the times God's Book tells us to ""try."" Now count the times it tells us to ""trust.” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“Your mind can go ahead and imagine what it wants to imagine, but a true friend will always remain true, in spite of the false messages running through your mind.” ― Michael Bassey Johnson"

"“When we look for success, it should be for the sole purpose of boasting sincerely in Christ. There's no other reason for it. Success is only worth it when the more intense it gets for you, the more you find yourself bragging for his glory rather than your own.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“I guess this thing we call faith is a climb. I always wanted to think of it as a big slide straight into the arms of God who waits at the bottom to catch us. But instead, He's a God who's on top of things - & like any mountain you climb, the closer we get to Him, the steeper the terrain.” ― Lisa Samson"
"“So much had been surrendered! And to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape (...)” ― Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray"
"“Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.""""Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.” ― Elie Wiesel, Night"
"“Today is the day you have to start believing in yourself. No one can do it for you anymore.” ― Lauren Graham ""Someday Someday Maybe"""
"“It was my first clue that atheists are my brothers and sisters of another faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith. Like me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them—and then they leap.” ― Yann Martel, Life of Pi"
"“Man asks and God replies but we don't understand his replies because they dwell in the depths of our souls and remain there until we die.” ― Elie Wiesel"
"“If you knew how the journey was going to end, you could afford to be patient along the path.” ― Joseph J. Ellis, Revolutionary Summer: The Birth of American Independence"
"“The prison inspector and the warders, though they had never understood or gone into the meaning of these dogmas and of all that went on in church, believed that they must believe, because the higher authorities and the Tsar himself believed in it. Besides, though faintly (and themselves unable to explain why), they felt that this faith defended their cruel occupations. If this faith did not exist it would have been more difficult, perhaps impossible, for them to use all their powers to torment people, as they were now doing, with a quiet conscience. The inspector was such a kind-hearted man that he could not have lived as he was now living unsupported by his faith.” ― Leo Tolstoy, Resurrection"
"“But all the while, there was one thing we most needed even from the start, and certainly will need from here on out into the New Jerusalem: the ability to take our freedom seriously and act on it, to live not in fear of mistakes but in the knowledge that no mistake can hold a candle to the love that draws us home. My repentance, accordingly, is not so much for my failings but for the two-bit attitude toward them by which I made them more sovereign than grace. Grace - the imperative to hear the music, not just listen for errors - makes all infirmities occasions of glory.” ― Robert Farrar Capon, Between Noon & Three: Romance, Law & the Outrage of Grace"
"“A conscious human is driven by their conscience, not popular opinion.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“He does not regard the quantity of faith, but the quality. He does not measure its degree, but its truth. He will not break any bruised reed, nor quench any smoking flax. He will never let it be said that any perished at the foot of the cross.” ― J.C. Ryle"
"“Hope and faith goes hand-in-hand, because without hope there is no faith. The same goes with want and needs, without any wants, there no need to have a need” ― Temitope Owosela"
"“Your body - every body is a marvel. A wonder of creation. [...] The day your first opened your eyes, Anna, God asked just one thing: that you live.” ― Emma Donoghue, The Wonder"

"“How do we remain faithful to our own spiritual imagination and not betray what we know in our own bodies? The world is holy. We are holy. All life is holy.” ― Terry Tempest Williams, Leap"
"“O Heavenly Children, do not forget that God is here, there and everywhere. The birds are his eyes and the air is his ears. And as you sleep, your heart and soul rest naked before him. He can drink from the rivers of your thoughts, and even feel the wetness of your tears.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“Men cannot expect to do ill and fare well, but to find that done to them which they did to others.” ― Matthew Henry, Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible"
"“It may be a procession of faithful failures that enriches the soil of godly success. Faithful actions are not religious acts. They are not even necessary actions undertaken by people of faith. Faithful actions, whether they are marked by success or they end in failure, are actions that are compelled by goodness.” ― Archbishop Desmond Tutu"
"“The only way God can strengthen his presence in our will is to weaken his presence in our feelings. Otherwise we would become spiritual cripples, unable to walk without emotional crutches. This is why he gives us dryness, sufferings, and failures.” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“I believe we are more ready to embrace our lives in the here and now when we are able to recognize the continuity between the immanence of God in our world and eternity. Rather than simply waiting to be liberated to another time or place, we are being invited to collaborate in the healing and redemption of our world.” ― Mark Scandrette, Soul Graffiti: Making a Life in the Way of Jesus"
"“Dusty, dark, cold, and hard, coal has no beauty of its own, but when it is consummated by fire it is beautiful and becomes what it was designed to be.” ― Frederica Mathewes-Green, At the Corner of East and Now: A Modern Life in Ancient Christian Orthodoxy"
"“God really performs the miracle of multiplying our time, but only if we give it to him first.” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“The universe contains many planets which make it what it is – a unified system. In addition, our bodies contain many organs, and each part is congruent to a planet in our solar system. The universe we see out our eyes is a mirror of what is within us. This is what God meant by making man in his image. We are all made as a reflection of God and that reflection of him is within us. Furthermore, not only are all religions connected to the same Truth, or Cosmic Heart, but this concept is also mirrored in the pantheons of ancient religions, where each of the many gods simply represented one set of characteristics of the ONE. And in all cases, these many gods symbolized the planets, therefore mimicking the different parts of the universe and the ONE God’s many mirrors (He Who is All). The structure behind all polytheistic religions of the past and present is one and the same. They are all built on the same foundation as Nature.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“Ultimately we have nothing to fear. Jesus loves us, and he invites us to be confident in that love. As we seek to obey Him, we are not called to assess the risk involved and determine whether or not obedience will be beneficial or safe for us. We are simply called to trust and obey.” ― Dan Baumann, A Beautiful Way: An Invitation To A Jesus-centered Life"

"“If we could summarize all, or almost all, of the New Testament letters, we would not be too far off the mark to say the theme is: “Grow up!” Just grow up.” ― David A. Fiensy, The Journey: Spiritual Growth in Galatians and Philippians"
"“Nothing but prayer can make saints because nothing but God can make saints, and we meet God in prayer. Prayer is the hospital for souls where we meet Doctor God.” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“It is debatable whether blind faith is truly faith at all. Faith is the perceptive gray area where scientific facts meet an individual's experiential truths - the extreme of the former is left feeling in the dark whereas the latter is caught blinded by the light. By proper scientific method, it is intellectually dishonest for me to declare the existence of God with utmost certainty, but to my individual spirit, I would be intellectually dishonest to deny the existence of God even for a second. This leaves the best of both worlds, as the believer is called to be able to give reasons for his faith, a deviation from mere fantasy.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“I said, ""Where's all that delivering God's supposed to do?""He snorted. ""You're right, the only deliverance is the one we get for ourselves. The Lord doesn't have any hands and feet but ours.""""That doesn't say much for the Lord.""""It doesn't say much for us, either.” ― Sue Monk Kidd, The Invention of Wings"
"“To choose not to be part of a team or religion does not make me non-religious; for my religion is Truth and I am very much in love with God. I do not need to align myself with a specific messenger if I already understand God’s message. And the way I think is not considered ‘New Age’, since common sense is not new. So long as you act and speak with love and truth in you, and are good to your fellow man — in that you treat everybody as you would want yourself to be treated, your heart will stand by God regardless of the label you have assigned to your mind.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“I Am ! Two powerful words.... You must confess... I Am who God called me to be. I Am a Success. I Am not what you think of me. I Am more than a conqueror. I Am walking by Faith. I Am a Gift.” ― Amaka Imani Nkosazana, Release The Ink"
"“The Power that knows the way will take care of you. The One who makes the sun shine, the grass grow, the apples grow perfectly on apple trees. The food that sustains us, nourishes us, everything has been lovingly provided for us. Have faith. Trust the Power that knows the way. This is a first step. To have total faith and total trust in the Infinite, the One. Youmay call this God if you want to. Makes no difference what you call it. It is within you. It is without you. It is everywhere. (p. 195)” ― Robert Adams, Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams"
"“The conflicting missions of the two armies seemed to have no fog, no gray, only black-and-white clarity. I had lived my life in terms of compromise, rule-bending, trade-offs, concessions, bargaining, striking deals, finding middle ground. In these two great armies, there was no such thing. Good was good, and evil was evil, and they shared no common ground.” ― Randy Alcorn, Edge of Eternity"
"“sometime life is full of joy,and sometime life is full of pain and tears but we have to defeat it” ― Meena Khan"
"“God is not a God of confusion, although at times one's judgment, for a period, may become clouded in the mi(d)st of one's growth process. I stopped fooling myself into thinking that Christ is always for the cool kids and never for those upright and uptight religious people everybody hates.” ― Criss Jami, Healology"
"“The power of one is above all things the power to believe in yourself, often well beyond any latent ability you may have previously demonstrated. The mind is the athlete; the body is simply the means it uses to run faster or longer, jump higher, shoot straighter, kick better, swim harder, hit further, or box better. Hoppie's dictum to me, ""First with the head and then with the heart,"" was more than simply mixing brains with guts. It meant thinking well beyond the powers of normal concentration and then daring your courage to follow your thoughts.” ― Bryce Courtenay, The Power of One"
"“It is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it.” ― G.K. Chesterton"
"“People think of faith as being something that you don't really believe, a device in helping you believe simply it. Of course that is quite wrong. As Pascal says, faith is a gift of God. It is different from the proof of it. It is the kind of faith God himself places in the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument...He says of it, too, that it is the heart which is aware of God, and not reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not be reason.” ― Malcolm Muggeridge, The End of Christendom"
"“Grace is the celebration of life, relentlessly hounding all the non-celebrants in the world. It is a floating, cosmic bash shouting its way through the streets of the universe, flinging the sweetness of its cassations to every window, pounding at every door in a hilarity beyond all liking and happening, until the prodigals come out at last and dance, and the elder brothers finally take their fingers out of their ears.” ― Robert Farrar Capon, Between Noon & Three: Romance, Law & the Outrage of Grace"
"“Do you know, the only people I can have a conversation with are the Jews? At least when they quote scripture at you they are not merely repeating something some priest has babbled in their ear. They have the great merit of disagreeing with nearly everything I say. In fact, they disagree with almost everything they say themselves. And most importantly, they don't think that shouting strengthens their argument.” ― Iain Pears, The Dream of Scipio"
"“We do know that no person can be saved except through Christ. We do not know that only those who know Him can be saved by Him.” ― C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity"
"“Some communities don't permit open, honest inquiry about the things that matter most. Lots of people have voiced a concern, expressed a doubt, or raised a question, only to be told by their family, church, friends, or tribe: ""We don't discuss those things here.""I believe the discussion itself is divine. Abraham does his best to bargain with God, most of the book of Job consists of arguments by Job and his friends about the deepest questions of human suffering, God is practically on trial in the book of Lamentations, and Jesus responds to almost every question he's asked with...a question.” ― Rob Bell, Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell, and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived"
"“Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio.” ― Ernest Hemingway, The Old Man and the Sea"
"“The Church does not dispense the sacrament of baptism in order to acquire for herself an increase in membership but in order to consecrate a human being to God and to communicate to that person the divine gift of birth from God.” ― Hans Urs von Balthasar, Unless You Become Like This Child"
"“Feet sandaled with dreams tread paths of vision leading to wisdom’s sharp peaks.” ― Aberjhani, The River of Winged Dreams"
"“Gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world.” ― Sarah Ban Breathnach"
"“Religious people tend to encounter, among those who are not, a cemented certainty that belief in God is a crutch for the weak and the fearful...Now the belief in God may turn out at the last trump to be a mistake. Meantime, let us be quite clear, it is not merely the comfort of the simple--though it is that too, much to its glory--it is a formidable intellectual position with which most of the first-class minds of the human race, century in and century out, have concurred, each in his own way....speaking of crutches--Freud can be a crutch, Marx can be a crutch, rationalism can be a crutch, and atheism can be two canes and a pair of iron braces. We none of us have all the answers, nor are we likely to have. But in the country of the halt, the man who is surest he has no limp may be the worst-crippled.” ― Herman Wouk, This Is My God: The Jewish Way of Life"
"“How could anyone love Him? What did you just tell me yourself about the world? Don't you see, everybody hates God now. It's not that God is dead in the twentieth century. It's that everybody hates Him! At least I think so.” ― Anne Rice, Memnoch the Devil"
"“Floating there I held onto faith. Because you can't know who might cross your path or who will take your breath away. You can't know what friends might actually become sisters because they stayed by your side. You can't know when there'll be an unexpected detour that'll take you to the place where you were always meant to be.” ― Holly C. Corbett, The Lost Girls: Three Friends. Four Continents. One Unconventional Detour Around the World."
"“The greatest joy is joy in God. This is plain from Psalm 16:11: ""You [God] will make known to me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; in Your right hand there are pleasures forever."" Fullness of joy and eternal joy cannot be improved. Nothing is fuller than full, and nothing is longer than eternal. And this joy is owing to the presence of God, not the accomplishments of man. Therefore, if God wants to love us infinitely and delight us fully and eternally, he must preserve for us the one thing that will satisfy us totally and eternally; namely, the presence and worth of his own glory. He alone is the source of full and lasting pleasure. Therefore, his commitment to uphold and display his glory is not vain, but virtuous. God is the one being for whom self-exaltation is an infinitely loving act. If he revealed himself to the proud and self-sufficient and not to the humble and dependent, he would belittle the very glory whose worth is the foundation of our joy. Therefore, God's pleasure in hiding this from ""the wise and intelligent"" and revealing it to ""infants"" is the pleasure of God in both his glory and our joy.” ― John Piper, The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God"
"“Religion doesn't just cloud our minds. It asks us to deliberately deceive ourselves-- to replace reason with its opposite, faith. And when men operate on faith, they can no longer be reasoned with, which makes them more dangerous than any sane man, good or evil.” ― James L. Sutter, Death's Heretic"
"“The truth is, the Devil's job is easy.” ― Tyler Edwards, Zombie Church: Breathing Life Back into the Body of Christ"
"“I need no master to punish me in order to behave as I ought. If I did, I would be no more than a child who obeys his father's rules only because he fears the whip, and not because he actually means good.” ― Christopher Paolini, Inheritance"

"“You know, it's a sad and unfortunate state of affairs that you have to live in a world where eight-year-olds refuse to believe in anything that they cannot touch or measure, and anyone who happens to see a thing that is invisible to most people is immediately branded a lunatic.” ― Caitlín R. Kiernan, Daughter of Hounds"
"“The true value of a man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not possession of the Truth, but rather the pursuit of Truth by which he extends his powers and in which his ever-growing perfectibility is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent, and proud.” ― Gotthold Ephraim Lessing"
"“Love and faith are not common companions. More commonly power and fear consort with faith....Power is not to be crossed; one must respect and obey. Power means strength, whereas love is a human frailty the people mistrust. It is a sad fact of life that power and fear are the fountainheads of faith.” ― Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals"
"“PRAISE FOR 'THE JOURNEY HOME'Many saints are known and praised by all. We pray to them in litanies and celebrate their feast days. But the vast majority of holy men and women live heroic lives quietly before God. Loyal to family, lovers of God, servants in the Church, these unsung saints live everyday life as an example for us. David Hanneman is one such man. His story is exemplary and should be told to the world. He not only lived a noble life, but also suffered with heroism and grace as he passed into glory. This is a story to encourage and bless us all. We are thankful to Joseph Hanneman for sharing his father and making his story known to us who need such examples to encourage us as we face the difficulties and challenges of life.” ― Stephen K. Ray"

"“We may not know what lies ahead of us in the future years, nor even in the days or hours immediately beyond. But for a few yards, or possibly only a few feet, the track is clear, our duty is plain, our course is illumined. For that short distance, for the next step, lighted by the inspiration of God, go on!

"“Each of them had done their best. Matt was still his friend. For Meredith, maybe the day would come when she could look at him and not think “inhuman” — or at least not think it immediately and constantly. Maybe Bonnie, the moth, would be able to stay away from the unholy flame. Now, there was something to worry about. He could all too easily see Bonnie taking a walk on the very wild side with Damon. His brother had a soft spot for her already, she knew. But if either of them had a problem, he already knew what he had to do to find a plan for a solution.Just look up.” ― L.J. Smith, Blood Will Tell"
"“We do matter. To believe that our lives are meaningful is the essence of faith. We are not as large, or as bright, or as eternal as the stars, but we carry humankind's message of love across the galaxy. We are the first. We are the world makers. Our nourishment is hope. Like the tender reed shaking in the wind, we will reach up to a new sun.” ― Amy Kathleen Ryan, Glow"
"“Sitting calmly on a ship in fair weather is not a metaphor for having faith; but when the ship has sprung a leak, then enthusiastically to keep the ship afloat by pumping and not to seek the harbor--that is the metaphor for having faith. (Concluding Unscientific Postscript)” ― Søren Kierkegaard"
"“Nothing will get you into trouble so deep or as sad as faith.” ― Rick Bass, The Watch"
"“Are we alone? Over time, you will come up with various answers to that same nagging question. Eventually one day it will occur to you that this endless asking is the answer you have been looking for.

"“These people fail to realize that it is on the inside that God must be defended, not on the outside. They should direct their anger at themselves. For evil in the open is but evil within that has been let out.” ― Yann Martel, Life of Pi"
"“Here's another poem,like all others before and after,dedicated to you.There isn't anything left to be saidbut I will spend my lifetrying to put you into words.You who is every goodness,every optimismand hope.Your love is a better fate for methan anything I could wish for.If you are a part of me, then you’re the best part.And if you're separate from me, then you are my destination.But I’ve become a weary traveller,so please,let us never be apart.” ― Kamand Kojouri"

"“There are two missions we are obligated to carry out during our life journey. The first, is to seek Truth throughout our lifetime. The second, is simply to be good. Engrave it in your mind that life is just one big board game where you have to make it from start to finish by being good. That is all you have to do. The hardest part, is dealing with all the obstacles that prevent smooth sailing. The trick is, to always strive to be the right person in all situations – regardless of personal cost to you. Your aim is to make sure the right book on your shoulder weighs more that the bad book on the left. The scales are real. Regardless of your chosen faith, there is a measurement system to be found in all of the world's religions. After all, does it make sense for all souls, good or bad, to end up in the same place? Of course not. To really secure the very best setting in the afterlife, the vibrations of your good deeds must surpass your death.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“But miracles are not for the asking; they come only when the stern eyes of God droop shut for a moment, and Our Lady takes advantage of His inattention to grant an illicit mercy. God...is an Anglican, whereas Our Lady is of the True Faith; the two of Them have an uneasy relationship, unable to agree on anything, except that if They divorce, the Devil will leap gleefully into the breach.” ― Michel Faber, The Crimson Petal and the White"
"“The parent is protector and trainer, but never the ultimate teacher. Every parent is responsible for teaching their kid basic moral conduct, manners, the difference between love and hate, and right from wrong. However, after maturity, the child must set off to seek knowledge on their own. Religion is never to be forced. And you cannot threaten your child with hell and tell them your religion is the only right way. There is no one right way.

"“A pineapple is a compilation of berries that grow and fuse together. When joined, they create a single fruit. And within each eyelet, contains a location where a flower may grow. I see the Creator of all existence as the crown on a pineapple, and all religions of the world as the spiky eyelets, where each eyelet symbolizes a different religion or race under the same crown. Each garden of faith may have different perspectives of God, yet every garden belongs to the same God.” ― Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"
"“If I were to believe in God enough to call him a murderer, then I might also believe enough that he, as a spirit, exists beyond death; and therefore only he could do it righteously. For the physical being kills a man and hatefully sends him away, whereas God, the spiritual being, kills a man and lovingly draws him nigh.” ― Criss Jami, Healology"
"“I accept the Organic Trinity of Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal with as much authority as I accept the Holy Trinity. Both are sacred.” ― Terry Tempest Williams, Leap"
"“Thus we arrive at the singular conclusion that of all the information passed by our cultural assets it is precisely the elements which might be of the greatest importance to us and which have the task of solving the riddles of the universe and of reconciling us to the sufferings of life -- it is precisely those elements that are the least well authenticated of any.” ― Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion"
"“Before you have faith you must believe, and before you believe there must be evidence of some sort to persuade the mind. Faith is remembering that evidence and holding to it against all that seems to challenge or contradict it.” ― John Christopher, The Prince in Waiting"
"“At the tattoo parlor, my friend worked with needle and ink applying a design to the skin on his client's back, as the three of us sat discussing our spiritual desires and ambivalence about religion. In the midst of our conversation, the man under the needle turned and said, 'Jesus is cool, it's just that they have f***ed with Jesus. I mean, Christianity was at its best when it was secret and hidden and you could die for it.' This profound, if crass, statement recognizes that the power of the gospel lay in its ability to be a counter-cultural and revolutionary force - not only a story to believe, but a distinctive way of life. The man's comment prompted me to consider the questions: Am I in some measure complicit in the domestication of Jesus?” ― Mark Scandrette, Soul Graffiti: Making a Life in the Way of Jesus"
"“I had another reason for seeking Him, for trying to espy His face, a professional one. God and literature are conflated in my mind. Why this is, I’m not sure. Perhaps because great books seem heavensent. Perhaps because I know that each nove is a puny but very valiant attempt at godlike behavior. Perhaps because there is no difference between the finest poetry and most transcendent mysticism. Perhaps because writers like Thomas Merton, who are able to enter the realm of the spirit and come away with fine, lucid prose. Perhaps because of more secular writers, like John Steinbeck, whose every passage, it seems to me, peals with religiousity and faith. It once occured to me that literature — all art really — is either talking to people about God, or talking to God about people.” ― Paul Quarrington, The Boy on the Back of the Turtle: Seeking God, Quince Marmalade, and the Fabled Albatross on Darwin's Islands"
"“Faith and science, I have learned, are two sides of the same coin, separated by an expanse so small, but wide enough that one side can't see the other. They don't even know they're connected. Father and Lily were two sides of the same coin, I've decided, and maybe I am the space in between.” ― Mary E. Pearson, The Adoration of Jenna Fox"
"“I've got my own moral compass to steer byA guiding star beats a spirit in the skyAnd all the preaching voices -Empty vessels ring so loudAs they move among the crowdFools and thieves are well disguisedIn the temple and market placeLike a stone in the riverAgainst the floods of springI will quietly resistLike the willows in the windOr the cliffs along the oceanI will quietly resistI don't have faith in faithI don't believe in beliefYou can call me faithlessI still cling to hopeAnd I believe in loveAnd that's faith enough for meI've got my own spirit level for balanceTo tell if my choice is leaning up or downAnd all the shouting voicesTry to throw me off my courseSome by sermon, some by forceFools and thieves are dangerousIn the temple and market placeLike a forest bows to winterBeneath the deep white silenceI will quietly resistLike a flower in the desertThat only blooms at nightI will quietly resist” ― Rush"
"“Pure heart, pure soul.” ― Lailah Gifty Akita"
"“I don't trust people. The good part is, i don't really have to. I've surrendered my faith to the Higher power, and it's unconditional love for me. Who am i to question it's motives? Even if there are things i can't understand. This is why there's no need to trust people - if they are on my path, it means they are good for me.” ― Aleksandra Ninkovic"
"“I have no horror of death, and place no value on any god. Cease therefore. For I come ready to die; and first I bring you these gifts. (Mezentius)” ― Virgil, The Aeneid"
"“Mo Ran trembled and used all his strength to raise his head. He saw his God riding the dragon, swooping down from the sky. He saw the white clothes of his God, looking like an immortal exiled. As he got closer, the face next to the soaring dragon horn became clear . Mo Ran's heart suddenly hurt, and it was even more painful than being stabbed by a knife. He saw his God crying, Chu Wanning...he was crying .” ― Meatbun Doesn't Eat Meat, 二哈和他的白猫师尊"
"“Jesus said in Matthew 5:45, “He causes the sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.” This was certainly a far cry from the cruel and vengeful god of the Qur’an.” ― Mosab Hassan Yousef"
"“It has hindered where it might have helped; it has been evasive when it was morally bound to be forthright; it has separated believers on the basis of color, although it has declared its mission to be a universal brotherhood under Jesus Christ. Christian love is the white man's love for himself and for his race.” ― Malcolm X, The Autobiography of Malcolm X"

"“Faith is the surrender of the mind, it's the surrender of reason, it's the surrender of the only thing that makes us different from other animals. It's our need to believe and to surrender our skepticism and our reason, our yearning to discard that and put all our trust or faith in someone or something, that is the sinister thing to me. ... Out of all the virtues, all the supposed virtues, faith must be the most overrated” ― Christopher Hitchens"
"“Souls reconstructed with faith transform agony into peace.” ― Aberjhani, The River of Winged Dreams"
"“Everywhere we shine death and life burn into something new…” ― Aberjhani, Elemental: The Power of Illuminated Love"
"“That's for the best. Otherwise they might realize they're in prison. It can't be helped. You women are used to harems and prisons. A person can spend his whole life between four walls. If he doesn't think or feel that he's a prisoner, then he's not a prisoner. But then there are people for whom the whole planet is a prison, who see the infinite expanse of the universe, the millions of stars and galaxies that remain forever inaccessible to them. And that awareness makes them the greatest prisoners of time and space.” ― Vladimir Bartol, Alamut"

"“Hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark.” ― George Iles"
"“The more a nation gets into darkness, the more it's going to hate the light. The more it's going to run from the light. And we have a generation of people who have given themselves to darkness, and they've embraced atheism, because it gets them away from moral responsibility to God.” ― Ray Comfort"

"“Many people seek fellowship because they are afraid to be alone...let him who cannot be alone beware of community. He will do harm to himself and to the community.

You cannot escape yourself, for God has singled you out.” ― Dietrich Bonhoeffer"

"“Then I almost pity Judd.” Leaning in, she whispered, “Make him uncomfortable. Don’t take no for an answer. Push. Push him until he loses control. Remember, fire melts ice.” Brenna looked into those eerie night-sky eyes as Faith drew back. “Could be a dangerous game.” “You don’t seem to be the kind of woman content with safe and easy.” “No.” She also wasn’t the kind of woman who gave up at the first obstacle. Judd might be categorically Psy, but she was a SnowDancer.” ― Nalini Singh, Caressed by Ice"
"“[at CMC West Coast 2011, on 1 Samuel 14] If just a few of you would step up and be like Jonathan ... as you step out in faith, you know what's going to happen? There'll be people like Saul who'll say, ""God's doing something through that guy, God's doing something through that girl. I want to be a part of that.” ― Francis Chan"
"“It is a part of our nature to survive. Faith is an instinctive response to aspects of existence that we cannot explain by any other means, be it the moral void we perceive in the universe, the certainty of death, the mystery of the origin of things, the meaning of our lives, or the absence of meaning. These are basic and extremely simple aspects of existence, but our limitations prevent us from responding in an unequivocal way and for that reason we generate an emotional response, as a defense mechanism. It's pure biology.” ― Carlos Ruiz Zafón, The Angel's Game"

"“If we rely on anything else besides faith to maintain the practice of the presence of God, we will certainly fail, whether this is our feelings, or experiences, or sincerity, or good intentions, or reasonings, or plans. The reason these things will fail while faith will not fail is that all these things depend on us, while faith depends on God. It is a gift of God.” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"
"“Have faith in your beliefs” ― Michael Christos Zeis"
"“God is perceived by the heart, not by your reason. But what is reason? Your heart simplifying God’s guidance to fit your own needs.” ― Shannon L. Alder"
"“Like a lot of once devout people who have lost their faith, I had holes the size of heaven and hell in my head and in my heart.” ― Sarah Vowell"
"“Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love - but sometimes it was so hard to love. Sometimes my heart was sinking so fast with anger, desolation and weariness, I was afraid it would sink to the very bottom of the Pacific and I would not be able to lift it back up.” ― Yann Martel, Life of Pi"
"“We are afraid of religion because it interprets rather than observance. Religion does not confirm that there are hungry people in the world; it interprets the hungry to be our brethren whom we allowed to starve.” ― Dorothee Sölle"
"“We tend to think that refusing to exalt Christ is staying true to our self-will and personal freedom when really we are condemning ourselves. Sure, we can pretend to stay true to ourselves, but if you want to talk about reality, all of that is completely trivial if this life is an island and He's the only pilot with a plane and a flight plan.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“And here she was. Lying on the floor of a dusty, empty, locked room thinking how grateful she felt.She smiled, though it hurt tremendously to do so, thinking how blessed she had been to have spent twelve years with the most precious gifts from God. She felt honored that they called her mother. She knew she had done the best she could teaching them about life and love, faith and family.

"“A faith that does not result in activity of any kind is a dead faith; it is empty, worthless, insincere.” ― Derek Prince"
"“Authentic faith leads us to treat others with unconditional seriousness and to a loving reverence for the mystery of the human personality. Authentic Christianity should lead to maturity, personality, and reality. It should fashion whole men and women living lives of love and communion. False, manhandled religion produces the opposite effect. Whenever religion shows contempt or disregards the rights of persons, even under the noblest pretexts, it draws us away from reality and God.” ― Brennan Manning, The Ragamuffin Gospel"
"“Remember that our Heavenly Father knows us perfectly and knows what's best for us . . . . Surely, His knowledge is greater than ours. We just have to have faith in Him. If we don't, well, that doesn't change what happened, it just makes us more miserable because we refuse to trust His will. Our Heavenly Father wants us to have joy. And happiness. But we need to look for those opportunities that give us joy. If we don't, what would be the purpose for existing?” ― Jeri Gilchrist, Out of Nowhere"
"“Faith isn't absence of doubt. It's belief without proof, not without question.” ― Rosemary Clement-Moore, Hell Week"

"“Faith is a quiet certainty that there is both a higher purpose to life and a higher power that oversees that purpose. Faith is knowing that we do not have to go it alone during our darkest hours and, even when we feel utterly victimized and weak, there is still something brighter, purer, and more potent than anything we can imagine that cares enough to reach out and offer a shoulder for us to lean upon. The object of faith takes many forms and many names, but the universal truth is faith itself.” ― Michelle Belanger, The Ghost Hunter's Survival Guide: Protection Techniques for Encounters With The Paranormal"
"“We will experience the life we have the faith to experience.” ― Julia Cameron, Faith and Will: Weathering the Storms in Our Spiritual Lives"
"“Thus Milton refines the question down to a matter of faith,"" said Coleridge, bringing the lecture to a close, ""and a kind of faith more independent, autonomous - more truly strong, as a matter of fact - than the Puritans really sought. Faith, he tells us, is not an exotic bloom to be laboriously maintained by the exclusion of most aspects of the day to day world, nor a useful delusion to be supported by sophistries and half-truths like a child's belief in Father Christmas - not, in short, a prudently unregarded adherence to a constructed creed; but rather must be, if anything, a clear-eyed recognition of the patterns and tendencies, to be found in every piece of the world's fabric, which are the lineaments of God. This is why religion can only be advice and clarification, and cannot carry any spurs of enforcement - for only belief and behavior that is independently arrived at, and then chosen, can be praised or blamed. This being the case, it can be seen as a criminal abridgement of a person's rights willfully to keep him in ignorance of any facts - no piece can be judged inadmissible, for the more stones, both bright and dark, that are added to the mosaic, the clearer is our picture of God.” ― Tim Powers, The Anubis Gates"

"“For several centuries, the Celtic church of Ireland was spared the Greek dualism of matter and spirit. They regarded the world with the clear vision of faith.

"“The force that played havoc with the cortisol in my blood was the same force that helped my body recover; if I felt better one day and worse the next, it was unchanged. It chose no side. It gave the girl next to me in the hospital pneumonia; it also gave her white blood cells that would resist the infection. And the atoms in those cells, and the nuclei in those atoms, the same bits of carbon that were being spun into new planets in some corner of space without a name. My insignificance had become unspeakably beautiful to me. That unified force was a god too massive, too inhuman, to resist with the atheism in which I had been brought up. I became a zealot without a religion.” ― G. Willow Wilson"

"“...those who break the law should be loved more and not less for their sin, for if we do not forgive then is sin added to sin and the end is death.” ― Elizabeth Goudge, The White Witch"
"“...the ongoing suspicion that scientific discoveries or rigorous biblical scholarship will undermine faith is a tacit admission that faith is threatened by knowledge, because it is ultimately constructed on weak or faulty assumptions and, like the proverbial house of cards, needs to be ""protected"" from collapsing.

"“Sometimes asking God for a reason for something is like asking Him why the sky is blue. There is a complex, scientific reason for it, Claire, but most children, including you, are content with knowing it is blue because it is.

Which is the better story, the story with animals or the story without animals?' Mr. Okamoto: 'That's an interesting question?' Mr. Chiba: 'The story with animals.' Mr. Okamoto: 'Yes. The story with animals is the better story.' Pi Patel: 'Thank you. And so it goes with God.” ― Yann Martel"
"“So many things which once had distressed or revolted him — the speeches and pronouncements of the learned, their assertions and their prohibitions, their refusal to allow the universe to move — all seemed to him now merely ridiculous, non-existent, compared with the majestic reality, the flood of energy, which now revealed itself to him: omnipresent, unalterable in its truth, relentless in its development, untouchable in its serenity, maternal and unfailing in its protectiveness.” ― Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Hymn of the Universe"

They will one day come to the place that even the greatest of windstorms cannot affect their ability to produce fruit.” ― John Bevere, The Bait Of Satan: Living Free from the Deadly Trap of Offense"
"“the believer claims to know, not just that God exists, but that his most detailed wishes are not merely knowable but actually known. Since religion drew its first breath when the species lived in utter ignorance and considerable fear, I hope I may be forgiven for declining to believe that another human being can tell me what to do, in the most intimate details of my life and mind, and to further dictate these terms as if acting as proxy for a supernatural entity.” ― Christopher Hitchens, Is Christianity Good for the World?"
"“It comes down to 'fear' and 'faith'. 'Fear' of what stands in front of me. 'Faith' in believing that the resources I possess can handle what stands in front of me. If I stop at the former, I will change nothing. If I embrace the latter, I can change everything.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“What you do in the Lord is not in vain. You are not oiling the wheels of a machine that's about to roll over a cliff. You are not restoring a great painting that's shortly going to be thrown on the fire. You are not planting rosed in a garden that's about to be dug up for a building site. You are -- strange though it may seem, almost as hard to believe as the resurrection itself -- accomplishing something that will become in due course part of God's new world. Every act of love, gratitude, and kindness; every work of art or music inspired by the love of God and delight in the beauty of his creation; every minute spent teaching a severely handicapped child to read or walk; every act of care and nurture, of comfort and support, for one's fellow human beings and for that matter one's fellow nonhuman creatures; and of course every prayer, all Spirit-led teaching, every deed that spreads the gospel, builds up the church, embraces and embodies holiness rather than corruption, and make the name of Jesus honored in the world -- all of this will find its way, through the resurrecting power of God, into the new creation that God will one day make.” ― N.T. Wright, Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church"

"“Remember young man, unceasingly,' Father Paissy began, without preface, 'that the science of this world, which has become a great power, has, especially in the last century, analysed everything divine handed down to us in the holy books. After this cruel analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was sacred of old. But they have only analysed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole world still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the masses of the people? It is still as strong and living even in the souls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! For even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old.” ― Fyodor Dostoyevsky"

"“The faithful man perceives nothing less than opportunity in difficulties. Flowing through his spine, faith and courage work together: Such a man does not fear losing his life, thus he will risk losing it at times in order to empower it.

"“Kuamini (mbali na imani, ambayo ni nia ya kujua kisichoweza kujulikana) ni kwa ajili ya vitu usivyoweza kuvielezea. Unaamini kwamba siku moja dawa ya UKIMWI au saratani itapatikana mahali fulani, ilhali huwezi kufanya majaribio ya kisayansi kulithibitisha hilo. Unaweza kusubiri hata miaka mia, lakini kama bado dawa haijapatikana, unaweza kusubiri hata miaka mingine mia. Kuamini ni kujifanya kujua (na mara nyingi kujifanya kujua ni uongo) na kuamini hakuhitaji maarifa. Kujua kunahitaji maarifa na ni kuamini unakoweza kukuthibitisha. Ukiniuliza kama simu yangu ipo mfukoni nitakwambia ndiyo ipo, kwa sababu nitaingiza mkono mfukoni na kuitoa na kuiona. Siamini kama ipo mfukoni, najua.” ― Enock Maregesi"

"“Surely we cannot take an open question like the supernatural and shut it with a bang, turning the key of the madhouse on all the mystics of history.

"“If the whole universe can be found in our own body and mind, this is where we need to make our inquires. We all have the answers within ourselves, we just have not got in touch with them yet. The potential of finding the truth within requires faith in ourselves.” ― Ayya Khema"
"“Some people say it is a shame. Others even imply that it would have been better if the baby had never been created. But the short time I had with my child is precious to me. It is painful to me, but I still wouldn't wish it away. I prayed that God would bless us with a baby. Each child is a gift, and I am proud that we cooperated with God in the creation of a new soul for all eternity.

"“There is no doubt that the United States has much to atone for, both domestically and abroad...To produce this horrible confection at home, start with our genocidal treatment of the Native Americans, add a couple hundred years of slavery, along with our denial of entry to Jewish refugees fleeing the death camps of the Third Reich, stir in our collusion with a long list of modern despots and our subsequent disregard for their appalling human rights records, add our bombing of Cambodia and the Pentagon Papers to taste, and then top with our recent refusals to sign the Kyoto protocol for greenhouse emissions, to support any ban on land mines, and to submit ourselves to the rulings of the International Criminal Court. The result should smell of death, hypocrisy, and fresh brimstone.” ― Sam Harris, The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason"
"“Men do not turn from God so easily. Not so easily. Deep in each man is the knowledge that something knows of his existence. Something knows, and cannot e fled nor hid from. To imagine otherwise is to imagine the unspeakable. It was never that this man ceased to believe in God. No. It was rather that he came to believe terrible things of him.” ― Cormac McCarthy, The Crossing"
"“A voice said, ""Climb."" And he said, ""How shall I climb?the mountains are so steep that I cannot climb.""The voice said, ""Climb or die.""He said, ""But how?I see no way up those steep ascents. This that is asked is too hard for me.""The voice said, ""Climb, or perish, soul and body of theemind and spirit of thee. There is no second chance for any son of man. Climb or die.""Then he remembered that he had read in the books of the bravest climbers on the hills of the earth that sometimes they were aware of the presence of a Companion on the mountains who was not one of the earthly party of climbers. And he rememberd a word in the Book of Mountaineers...it heartened him,for it told him that he was created to walk in precarious places, not on the easy levels of life.” ― Amy Carmichael, A Very Present Help: Life Messages of Great Christans"

"“This in essence is my goal. To set an example by doing what is good. If I live openly and honestly, I set an example of virtue, humanness, restoration, and healing. I give others permission to join me on my journey despite the fear of failure or the rejection it might elicit when they know they are not alone in their experience. The more of us who amass the courage to embark openly on this path, the more normal this experience becomes, effectively eliminating the tactic of shame and isolation that the enemy so often uses to cause us to falter.” ― Riisa Renee, Breaking the Silence"

"“Those who find no humor in faith are probably those who find the church a refuge for their own black way of looking at life, although I think many of us find the church a refuge for a lot of our personality faults. Those of us, for example, who never learned to dance feel that the church is an ideal place for us if we can find a church that doesn't believe in dancing. Then we can get away with never having learned how to dance. You can carry this in all sorts of directions and see that the church is a refuge for what is really a 'flaw' in your own makeup.” ― Charles M. Schulz, Charles M. Schulz: Conversations"

"“[Knowing God]... call it love, yes, only that can sound too emotional, or call it faith, and that can sound too cerebral. And what is it? Both, and neither... [its] the decision to be faithful, the patient refusal of easy gratifications... of Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane and on the cross, that bloody crown of love and faith. That is how I learn finally of a God who will not be fitted into my catergories and expectations... the living truth too great for me to see, trusting that He will see and judge and yet not turn me away... That is the mercy which will never give us, or even let us be content with less than itself and less than the truth... we have seen the truth enacted in our own world as mercy, grace and hope, as Jesus, the only-begotten, full of grace and truth..” ― Rowan Williams, Tokens of Trust"

"“More profoundly, Nihilist ""simplification"" may be seen in the universal prestige today accorded the lowest order of knowledge, the scientific, as well as the simplistic ideas of men like Marx, Freud, and Darwin, which underlie virtually the whole of contemporary thought and life.We say ""life,"" for it is important to see that the Nihilist history of our century has not been something imposed from without or above, or at least has not been predominantly this; it has rather presupposed, and drawn its nourishment from, a Nihilist soil that has long been preparing in the hearts of the people. It is precisely from the Nihilism of the commonplace, from the everyday Nihilism revealed in the life and thought and aspiration of the people, that all the terrible events of our century have sprung. The world-view of Hitler is very instructive in this regard, for in him the most extreme and monstrous Nihilism rested upon the foundation of a quite unexceptional and even typical Realism. He shared the common faith in ""science,"" ""progress,"" and ""enlightenment"" (though not, of course, in ""democracy""), together with a practical materialism that scorned all theology, metaphysics, and any thought or action concerned with any other world than the ""here and now,"" priding himself on the fact that he had ""the gift of reducing all problems to their simplest foundations."" He had a crude worship of efficiency and utility that freely tolerated ""birth control"", laughed at the institution of marriage as a mere legalization of a sexual impulse that should be ""free"", welcomed sterilization of the unfit, despised ""unproductive elements"" such as monks, saw nothing in the cremation of the dead but a ""practical"" question and did not even hesitate to put the ashes, or the skin and fat, of the dead to ""productive use."" He possessed the quasi-anarchist distrust of sacred and venerable institutions, in particular the Church with its ""superstitions"" and all its ""outmoded"" laws and ceremonies. He had a naive trust in the ""natural mom, the ""healthy animal"" who scorns the Christian virtues--virginity in particular--that impede the ""natural functioning"" of the body. He took a simple-minded delight in modern conveniences and machines, and especially in the automobile and the sense of speed and ""freedom"" it affords.There is very little of this crude Weltanschauung that is not shared, to some degree, by the multitudes today, especially among the young, who feel themselves ""enlightened"" and ""liberated,"" very little that is not typically ""modern.” ― Seraphim Rose"

"“There is no great religion without a great schism. All of them have it. And that's because you're dealing with something called faith. And faith is not something you can prove; faith is personal opinion. Uh, when you're dealing with something with certainty, like, y'know, science or logic, you don't have the--there's no wiggle room; that's why history is not filled with warring math cults, y'know, because you can settle the issue; you can prove something to be right or wrong, and that's the end of the argument: next case. Whereas, when you're dealing with faith, you can forever argue your point, or another point, because you're dealing with intangibles. Personally, I think, faith is what you ask of somebody when you don't have the goods to prove your point.” ― Tom Quinn"
"“Pain anguish and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man's capability of endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him...Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded in other words the weak suffer more where the trial is the same than the strong.” ― Alexandre Dumas, The Man in the Iron Mask"

"“If the church is to survive as a place where head and heart are equal partners in faith, then we will need to commit ourselves once again not to the worship of Christ, but to the imitation of Jesus. His invitation was not to believe, but to follow. (p. 145)” ― Robin R. Meyers, Saving Jesus from the Church: How to Stop Worshiping Christ and Start Following Jesus"
"“One, just one, but definitely one of the great benefits of private prayer is that you can’t hide from your motives. In corporate prayer, we can sound like “all that”. We can blow Jesus smoke like nobody’s bizness in a crowd but, get alone with Him, and He won’t let you get away with the fake stuff. Try blowing Jesus smoke in your prayer closet and you’ll cough on it every time. Truth? That penetrating gaze of His hurts, but afterwards, it never fails to heal.” ― Shellie Rushing Tomlinson"
"“A purposeless virtue is a contradiction in terms. Virtue, like harmony, cannot exist alone; a virtue must lead to harmony between one creature and another. To be good for nothing is just that. If a virtue has been thought a virtue long enough, it must be assumed to have practical justification - though the very longevity that proves its practicality may obscure it. That seems to be what happened with the idea of fidelity...Our age could be characterized as a manifold experiment in faithlessness, and if it has as yet produced no effective understanding of the practicalities of faith, it has certainly produced massive evidence of the damage and disorder of its absence.(pg.115-116, ""The Body and the Earth"")” ― Wendell Berry, The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays"
"“Faith is the door to the full inner life of the Church, a life which includes not only access to an authoritative teaching but above all to a deep personal experience which is at once unique and yet shared by the whole Body of Christ, in the Spirit of Christ.” ― Thomas Merton, Zen and the Birds of Appetite"
"“My mother believed in God's will for many years. It was af if she had turned on a celestial faucet and goodness kept pouring out. She said it was faith that kept all these good things coming our way, only I thought she said ""fate"" because she couldn't pronounce the ""th"" sound in ""faith"". And later I discovered that maybe it was fate all along, that faith was just an illusion that somehow you're in control. I found out the most I could have was hope, and with that I wasn't denying any possibility, good or bad. I was just saying, If there is a choice, dear God or whatever you are, here's where the odds should be placed.I remember the day I started thinking this, it was such a revelation to me. It was the day my mother lost her faith in God. She found that things of unquestioned certainty could never be trusted again. We had gone to the beach, to a secluded spot south of the city near Devil's Slide. My father had read in Sunset magazine that this was a good place to catch ocean perch. And although my father was not a fisherman but a pharmacist's assistant who had once been a doctor in China, he believed in his nenkan, his ability to do anything he put his mind to. My mother believed she had nenkan to cook anything my father had a mind to catch. It was this belief in their nenkan that had brought my parents to America. It had enabled them to have seven children and buy a house in Sunset district with very little money. It had given them the confidence to believe their luck would never run out, that God was on their side, that house gods had only benevolent things to report and our ancestors were pleased, that lifetime warranties meant our lucky streak would never break, that all the elements were now in balance, the right amount of wind and water.” ― Amy Tan, The Joy Luck Club"

Someday, I'll take you to the top of a windmill and teach you to dream.

He pressed a kiss to his daughter's cheek. ""So much…it hurts. But I reckon that's part of love, too.""-Dallas” ― Lorraine Heath, Texas Glory"
"“For many, the search for Jesus is initiated from experiencing an event in life so powerful, it awakens the dragons of faith; from pain so deep, it calls on the hidden fears of the soul in an effort to survive. For others it means a serious personal life survey that ultimately forces the confrontation with the futility, anesthetics, and despair in their lives.” ― W. Scott Lineberry, Tragedy and Loss and the Search for Jesus"

"“We take it for granted that Jesus was not interested in political life: his mission was purely religious. Indeed we have witnessed . . . the 'iconization' of the life of Jesus: 'This is a Jesus of hieratic, stereotyped gestures, all representing theological themes. In this way, the life of Jesus is no longer a human life, submerged in history, but a theological life -- an icon.” ― Gustavo Gutiérrez, A Theology of Liberation"
"“The woman had gone down on her knees and was shuffling slowly across the cruel ground towards the group of crosses: the dead baby rocked on her back. When she reached the tallest cross she unhooked the child and held the face against the wood and afterwards the loins: then she crossed herself, not as ordinary Catholics do, but in a curious and complicated pattern which included the nose and ears. Did she expect a miracle? And if she did, why should it not be granted her? the priest wondered. Faith, one was told, could move mountains, and here was faith--faith in the spittle that healed the blind man and the voice that raised the dead. The evening star was out: it hung low down over the edge of the plateau: it looked as if it was within reach: and a small hot wind stirred. The priest found himself watching the child for some movement. When none came, it was as if God had missed an opportunity. The woman sat down, and taking a lump of sugar from her bundle, began to eat, and the child lay quiet at the foot of the cross. Why, after all, should we expect God to punish the innocent with more life?” ― Graham Greene, The Power and the Glory"

"“A corollary of this has been that Christians have thought that they should only create art with a Pollyanna quality to it: paintings of birds and kittens, movies that extol family life and end happily, songs that are positive and uplifting – in short, works of art that show a world that is almost unfallen where no one experiences conflict and where sin is naughty rather than wicked.” ― Steve Turner, Imagine: A Vision for Christians in the Arts"
"“Jesus’s use of the phrasing “a new commandment” is frequently scanted in light of its implicit ramifications. Because Jesus at the Last Supper has executed the “new covenant” with his disciples, the Great Commandment itself now acquires an unprecedented meaning. Its new meaning belongs to this sudden revelation not merely about who God is but also about what love is. Previously the Great Commandment bade us to love God and our neighbor. Now this love can be comprehended only in an incarnational situation. Its incarnate presence is the activation of profound rhizomic relations that explode from the center toward the ends of the earth. We are commanded to be incarnational in relation to one another just as God at the cross was incarnational in Christ. . . . We are no longer simply Christ’s “followers"" - the pre-Easter form of relation to a master-and-teacher that is conventionally called “disciple” - but also perpetual Christ incarnators . . .” ― Carl Raschke, GloboChrist: The Great Commission Takes a Postmodern Turn"
"“it is not what happens to you, it is what happens in you.” ― Sesan Kareem"
"“An ironic religion -- one that never claims to be absolutely true but only professes to be relatively beautiful, and never promises salvation but only proposes it as a salubrious idea. A century ago there were people who thought art was the thing that could fuse the terms of this seemingly insuperable oxymoron, and no doubt art is part of the formula. But maybe consumerism also has something to teach us about forging an ironic religion -- a lesson about learning to choose, about learning the power and consequences, for good or ill, of our ever-expanding palette of choices. Perhaps . . . the day will come when the true ironic religion is found, the day when humanity is filled with enough love and imagination and responsibility to become its own god and make a paradise of its world, a paradise of all the right choices.” ― Alex Shakar, The Savage Girl"

"“Your faith is your conscience, and your conscience is your faith. You cannot have faith without a conscience, but you can have a conscience without faith. Man was designed to be good with or without religion, yet the challenge for many is staying good. Some people claim to be religious but have no conscience, while some people without religion are very much aware of their conscience. Therefore, a religious label does not define your character or validate your worth. In the end, all men will be judged by the amount of truth in them and the weight of their hearts. The heavier the conscience, the heavier the truth. The lighter the heart, the higher it goes. The only spiritual currency one has in the afterlife is amassed in the form of light, in that, the amount you have depends on the weight of your words and deeds in the living. Conscience is everything. Conscience is what connects us to the truth and light of the highest power source of all. God. The cosmic heart of the universe.” ― Suzy Kassem"

"“The creation of man is evidence for the love of God, the preservation of man is evidence for the patience of God, and Christ is evidence for the forgiveness of God.

"“Stand like a beaten anvil, when thy dreamIs laid upon thee, golden from the fire.Flinch not, though heavily through that furnace-gleamThe black forge-hammers fall on thy desire.Demoniac giants round thee seem to loom.'Tis but the world-smiths heaving to and fro.Stand like a beaten anvil. Take the doomTheir ponderous weapons deal thee, blow on blow.Needful to truth as dew-fall to the flowerIs this wild wrath and this implacable scorn.For every pang, new beauty, and new power,Burning blood-red shall on thy heart be born.Stand like a beaten anvil. Let earth's wrongBeat on that iron and ring back in song.” ― Alfred Noyes, Collected Poems Complete"
"“Religion, like science, is only noteworthy when it emphasizes a matter of what is true rather than whose belief is greater or lesser or which deity works for whom. Sincere religion and tested science are similar in that their assertions can be argued logically and objectively; otherwise, we get false cults and babble.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"
"“In any situation, there is a sacred-solution.” ― Lailah Gifty Akita, Think Great: Be Great!"
"“I cannot, of course, prove that there is no supervising deity who invigilates my every momentand who will pursue me even after I am dead. (I can only be happy that there is no evidence forsuch a ghastly idea, which would resemble a celestial North Korea in which liberty was not justimpossible but inconceivable.) But nor has any theologian ever demonstrated the contrary. Thiswould perhaps make the believer and the doubter equal—except that the believer claims to know,not just that God exists, but that his most detailed wishes are not merely knowable but actuallyknown. Since religion drew its first breath when the species lived in utter ignorance andconsiderable fear, I hope I may be forgiven for declining to believe that another human being cantell me what to do, in the most intimate details of my life and mind, and to further dictate theseterms as if acting as proxy for a supernatural entity. This tyrannical idea is very much older than P a g e | 5 of 29Christianity, of course, but I do sometimes think that Christians have less excuse for believing, letalone wishing, that such a horrible thing could be true.” ― Christopher Hitchens, Is Christianity Good for the World?"

"“Faith?” The word popped out before I could think about it. “Faith in what? A higher power? The gods? The universe?” My voice cracked at the end, and I realized what this whole thing had done to my faith, if I’d had any to begin with. I realized that the thought of a higher being in charge of all this made me angry.” ― Brodi Ashton, Evertrue"

"“Do you think I care if Aslan dooms me to death?” said the King. “That would be nothing, nothing at all.

It is as if the sun rose one day and were a black sun.” ― C.S. Lewis, The Last Battle"

"“‎Those who aren't following Jesus aren't his followers. It's that simple. Followers follow, and those who don't follow aren't followers.

"“Sometimes new opportunity means new opposition. Not everything God asks us to do will be comfortable.” ― Joyce Meyer"
"“Take faith, for example. For many people in our world, the opposite of faith is doubt. The goal, then, within this understanding, is to eliminate doubt. But faith and doubt aren't opposites. Doubt is often a sign that your faith has a pulse, that it's alive and well and exploring and searching.

"“I used to believe in so many things—elves and leprechauns, virgins riding unicorns. I trusted that the world was made up of people who were generally good, though they may have lost their way temporarily. The faith my mother gave me—the words she whispered when she said good night, the idea that gave me hope for the two of us even when we fought bitterly over trivial things, as mothers and daughters do, I guess—was her belief in love, a love so unconditional we could barely scratch at the edges of comprehending it.” ― Elissa Janine Hoole, Kiss the Morning Star"

Hope is power outside of the facts.The human mind longs for something better. Hope is not rational. Yet who need rationality when God is on our side? The capacity of hope is the most significant fact in life.” ― Tommy Tran"
"“No man succeeds without faith. Whether you call it religious faith or label it something else. I don't feel anything worthwhile is accomplished without it. When you believe there is a Supreme Being guiding the destiny of this universe and that within each of us there is a little part of that Being, then you will have faith in yourself, in your country, in that Supreme Being, and in humanity itself.” ― Walter Knott"
"“Keep me rather in this cage, and feed me sparingly, if you dare. Anything that brings me closer to illness and the edge of death makes me more faithful. It is only when you make me suffer that I feel safe and secure.

"“There's one other thing I'd like to remind you of, my dear. There've been many times when you've sworn to me that after all that life has dealt you, it was no longer possible for you to believe in anything. I replied that both life and my studies had led me to the same conclusion. I asked you, 'What is a person permitted, once he's realized that truth is unattainable and consequently doesn't exist for him?' Do you remember your answer?""""I do, ibn Sabbah. I said something like this: 'If a person realized that everything people call happiness, love and joy was just a miscalculation based on a false premise, he'd feel a horrible emptiness inside. The only thing that could rouse him from his paralysis would be to gamble with his own face and the face of others. The person capable of that would be permitted anything.” ― Vladimir Bartol, Alamut"

"“You are all soldiers of Christ,"" he said, ""and now is an opportunity given to you to show that you are worthy soldiers. When the troops of a worldly monarch go into battle they do so with head erect, with proud and resolute bearing, with flashing eye, and with high courage, determined to bear aloft his banner and to crown it with victory, even though it cost them their lives. Such is the mien that soldiers of Christ should bear in the mortal strife now raging round us. Let them show the same fearlessness of death, the same high courage, the same unlimited confidence in their Leader. What matter if they die in His service? He has told them what their work should be. He has bidden them visit the sick and comfort the sorrowing. What if there be danger in the work? Did He shrink from the Cross which was to end His work of love, and is it for His followers to do so? 'Though you go down into the pit,' He has said, 'I am there also'; and with His companionship one must be craven indeed to tremble. This is a noble opportunity for holding high the banner of Christ. There is work to be done for all, and as the work is done, men should see by the calm courage, the cheerfulness, and the patience of those that do it, that they know that they are doing His work, and that they are content to leave the issue, whatever it be, in His hands.” ― G. A. HENTY"
"“Imagine a land where people are afraid of dragons. It is a reasonable fear: dragons possess a number of qualities that make being afraid of them a very commendable response. Things like their terrible size, their ability to spout fire, or to crack boulders into splinters with their massive talons. In fact, the only terrifying quality that dragons do not possess is that of existence.Now, the people of this land know about dragons because their leaders have warned them about them. They tell stories about cruel dragons with razor teeth and fiery breath. They recount legends of dragons hunting by night on silent wings. In short, the leaders make sure that the people believe in all the qualities of dragons, including that key quality of existence. And then they control the people — when they need to — with their fear of dragons. The people pay a dragon-slaying tax … everyone stays indoors after dark to avoid being snatched by swooping claws … and nobody ever strays out of bounds for fear of being eaten well and truly up.Perhaps somebody will wonder if dragons aren’t, after all, fictitious because — despite their size — nobody seems to have actually seen one. And so it is necessary from time to time to provide evidence: a burnt tree or two, a splintered rock, the mysterious absence of a villager. The population is controlled by the dragons in its collective mind. It’s contrived superstition, and it is possible because the people do not know enough about the way the world works to know that dragons do not exist.” ― David Whiteland, Book of Pages"

"“I take leave to contradict those who say that salvation is an evolution! All that ever can be evolved out of the sinful heart of man is sin-and nothing else!

Papa God growed us up till we could wear long pants; then he licensed his name to dollar bills, left some car keys on the table, and got the fuck outta town”. Water rushes to his eye-holes. “Don’t be lookin up at no sky for help. Look down here, at us twisted dreamers”.

"“God is not someone you meet when you die. His smiling face will be the first and the most familiar to greet you on the other side of mortality. You’ll recognize Him and know in your heart of hearts that you’re not entering a new sphere, but returning home to the place you’ve always belonged.” ― Toni Sorenson"
"“Ah, but it is an interesting thing, that these things can so seldom be proved. If I were to perform some piece of, hrmf, magic for you, here in this room, you would claim a thousand ways it could have been done. Indeed, those ways might be exceedingly unlikely, but you would cling to them rather than accept the, mmn, the chance that magic, the eternal inexplicable, might be the true agent, and if you were strong enough in yourself, unafraid, unthreatened, here in your own chambers, well perhaps there would be no magic worked at all. It is a subjective force, you see, whereas the physical laws of the artificers are objective. A gear-train will turn without faith, but magic may not. And so, when your people demand, mmn, proof, there is none, but when you have forgotten and dismissed it, then magic creeps back into the gaps where you do not look for it.” ― Adrian Tchaikovsky, Dragonfly Falling"

"“We are not to be occupied with our feelings or symptoms,or our faith or lack of faith,but only with what God has said” ― Gordon Lindsay"
"“We are spiritual children of God the Father. We preach it. We sing it. But do we really understand it? Sometimes it’s easy to tell others they are loved, but not so easy to believe it of ourselves — not because we don’t think God loves His children, but because we may feel undeserving of His love. The adversary loves to remind us who we are not. Not pretty. Not smart. Not strong.

"“I don't want to base my life on a symbol,"" he said resolutely. ""I want reality, and the Christian faith has always been rooted in reality.

"“We have very little faith in the Lord, very little trust.

"“Life is a misery, death an uncertainty. Suppose it steals suddenly upon me, in what state shall I leave this world? When can I learn what I have here neglected to learn? Or is it true that death will cut off and put an end to all care and all feeling? This is something to be inquired into.But no, this cannot be true. It is not for nothing, it is not meaningless that all over the world is displayed the high and towering authority of the Christian faith. Such great and wonderful things would never have been done for us by God, if the life of the soul were to end with the death of the body. Why then do I delay? Why do I not abandon my hopes of this world and devote myself entirely to the search for God and for the happy life?” ― Augustine of Hippo, Confessions"
"“Dead men cannot take effective action; their power of influence on others lasts only till the grave. Deeds and actions that energise others belong only to the living. Well, then, look at the facts in this case. The Saviour is working mightily among men, every day He is invisibly persuading numbers of people all over the world, both within and beyond the Greek-speaking world, to accept His faith and be obedient to His teaching. Can anyone, in face of this, still doubt that He has risen and lives, or rather that He is Himself the Life? Does a dead man prick the consciences of men...?” ― St. Athanasius, On the Incarnation"
"“True virtue never appears so lovely as when it is most oppressed; and the divine excellency of real Christianity is never exhibited with such advantage as when under the greatest trials; then it is that true faith appears much more precious than gold, and upon this account is ""found to praise and honour and glory.” ― Jonathan Edwards, The Religious Affections"
"“‎God remains silent so that men and women may speak, protest, and struggle. God remains silent so that people may really become people. When God is silent and men and women cry, God cries in solidarity with them but doesn't intervene. God waits for the shouts of protest.” ― Elsa Tamez"
"“Unless there is within us that which is above us, we shall soon yield to that which is about us.” ― P.T. Forsyth"

"“...there is therefore now no condemnation for two reasons: you are dead now; and God, as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, has been dead all along. The blame game was over before it started. It really was. All Jesus did was announce that truth and tell you it would make you free. It was admittedly a dangerous thing to do. You are a menace. Be he did it; and therefore, menace or not, here you stand: uncondemned, forever, now. What are you going to do with your freedom?” ― Robert Farrar Capon, Between Noon & Three: Romance, Law & the Outrage of Grace"
"“This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all walls, wherever walls are to be found--I have letters that even the blind will be able to see. . . .

"“In the pragmatist, streetwise climate of advanced postmodern capitalism, with its scepticism of big pictures and grand narratives, its hard-nosed disenchantment with the metaphysical, 'life' is one among a whole series of discredited totalities. We are invited to think small rather than big – ironically, at just the point when some of those out to destroy Western civilization are doing exactly the opposite. In the conflict between Western capitalism and radical Islam, a paucity of belief squares up to an excess of it. The West finds itself faced with a full-blooded metaphysical onslaught at just the historical point that it has, so to speak, philosophically disarmed. As far as belief goes, postmodernism prefers to travel light: it has beliefs, to be sure, but it does not have faith.” ― Terry Eagleton, The Meaning of Life"
"“Our obedience is God's pleasure when it proves that God is our treasure. This is good news, because it means very simply that the command to obey is the command to be happy in God. The commandments of God are only as hard to obey as the promises of God are hard to believe. The Word of God is only as hard to obey as the beauty of God is hard to cherish.” ― John Piper, The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God"
"“For when God is said by these things to try men and prove them, to see what is in their hearts and whether they will keep His commandments or no, we are not to understand, that it is for His own information, or that He may obtain evidence Himself of their sincerity (for he needs no trials for His information); but chiefly for their conviction, and to exhibit evidence to their consciences...So when God tempted or tried Abraham with that difficult command of offering up his son, it was not for His satisfaction, whether he feared God or no, but for Abraham's own greater satisfaction and comfort, and the more clear manifestation of the favour of God to him.” ― Jonathan Edwards, The Religious Affections"
"“But I could tell thee of other things, Inglés, and do not doubt what thou simply cannot see nor cannot hear. Thou canst not hear what a dog hears. Nor canst thou smell what a dog smells. But already thou hast experienced a little of what can happen to man.” ― Ernest Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls"
"“The pure perfect truth of life is that we are here to create heaven on earth, to bring the perfection of what is above down to us, and in doing so to become transformed as human being into something great and beautiful.” ― Kathleen McGowan, The Poet Prince"
"“In all of knowable reality, God is unique. He is knowable not like the multiplication table or the table of elements; he alone is knowable as the one totally in control of being known. He is not at the disposal of the human mind. He is known when he wills to be known. Yet he is known in and through created reality, which is known naturally. Therefore the glory of God is exalted most not when we know God apart from observation and reading and study, but when we know God as a result of his free and gracious self-revelation in and through our earnest observation of and meditation on his work and Word in history.” ― John Piper, The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God"
"“Perhaps it is our obligation to be noble before it is our obligation to be happy.” ― Kathleen McGowan, The Poet Prince"

Faith is not, contrary to the usual ideas, something that turns out to be right or wrong, like a gambler's bet; it's an act, an intention, a project, something that makes you, in leaping into the future, go so far, far, far ahead that you shoot clean out of Time and right into Eternity, which is not the end of time or a whole lot of time or unending time, but timelessness, that old Eternal Now. So that you end up living not in the future ((in your intentional ""act of faith"")) but in the present. After all.(Courage is willful hope.)” ― Joanna Russ, On Strike Against God"
"“I feel no need for any other faith than my faith in human beings.” ― Pearl S. Buck"

It's not so much about how strong you are - it's about how strong God is.” ― Alan D. Wright, Lover of My Soul: Delighting in God's Passionate Love"
"“I'm just tired of hearing about God all the time. What has He got to do with anything?... I'm not going to be immoral or commit crimes because I don't believe. I don't even think about that. I just get so tired of Him getting the credit for things the human race achieves through its own effort. Now, there simply is no God. There's only man. And it's he who makes miracles.” ― Lorraine Hansberry"

"“Sin embargo, conocí a muchos internados que supieron ser fieles a su dignidad humana hasta el mismo fin. Los nazis lograron degradarlos físicamente, pero no fueron capaces de rebajarlos moralmente.Gracias a estos pocos, no he perdido totalmente mi fe en la humanidad.

"“The unqualified affirmation of the univeral will of salvation has radically changed the way of conceiving the mission of the Church in the world. . . . The work of salvation is a reality which occurs in history.” ― Gustavo Gutierrez, A Theology of Liberation: History, Politics, and Salvation"
"“Now listen. Faith is like oxygen. It keeps you afloat at all times. Sometimes you need it. Sometimes you don’t. but when you do need it you better be practiced at having faith, otherwise it won’t work. That’s why the missionaries built all the churches. Before we got those churches we weren’t practicing enough. That’s what prayers are for—practice, children. Practice.” ― Lloyd Jones, Mister Pip"

"“Our greatest challenge today...is to couple conviction with doubt. By conviction, I mean some pragmatically developed faith, trust, or centeredness; and by doubt I mean openness to the ongoing changeability, mystery, and fallibility of the conviction.” ― Kirk Schneider"
"“To come to faith on the basis of experience alone is unwise, though not so foolish as to reject faith altogether because of lack of experience ... the quality of a Christian's experience depends on the quality of his faith, just as the quality of his faith depends in turn on the quality of his understanding of God's truth.” ― Os Guinness, In two minds: The dilemma of doubt & how to resolve it"

"“How, then, shall we face the future? When the sailor is out on the ocean, when everything is changing all around him, when the waves are born and die, he does not stare down into the waves, because they are changing. He looks up at the stars. Why? Because they are faithful; they have the same location now that they had for our ancestors and will have for generations to come. By what means does he conquer the changeable? By the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith?

"“Wretched therefore as you may think it, I feel it no source of anguish to be associated with the blind, the afflicted, the infirm, and the mourners; since I may this hope that I am more immediately under the favour and protection of my dread Father” ― John Milton, Second Defense of the People of England"
"“God is love... You cannot even remotely imagine how He suffers. For He knows how difficult and painful it is for you. But He can change nothing of it, since otherwise He Himself would have to become something different, something other than love.” ― Søren Kierkegaard"
"“The leaves of a tree need to fall in order to rise anew.” ― Fatimah A. Bass, Where the Olive Trees Return: by Fatimah A. Bass"
"“I cannot shut my eyes and plunge confidently into the absurd; that is for me an impossibility, but I do not praise myself for it. I am convinced that God is love; this thought has for me a primordial lyrical validity. When it is present to me I am unspeakably happy; when it is absent I long for it more intensely than the lover for the object of his love. But I do not believe; this courage I lack.” ― Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling"
"“...there was no longer any reason why I should fast. I no longer accepted God's silence. As I swallowed my bowl of soup, I saw in the gesture an act of rebellion and protest against Him. And I nibbled my crust of bread. In the depths of my heart, I felt a great void.” ― Elie Wiesel, Night"
"“When God wants to test us, he sometimes takes away what we are craving the most. For reasons only he knows, he deprives us of our most beloved dreams. I believe that all people experience a time when they go to Calvary and carry the cross.""""My cross is the worst! It’s not made of wood but of the heaviest metal!""""All people believe that their own cross is the heaviest. The only thing that makes them feel better is looking at the suffering of others—seeing the pain of their fellow man.

"“...while God's plan is straight, the path to achieving it is twisted.” ― Antonio Iturbe, The Librarian of Auschwitz"
"“Corruption is the most pervasive and pernicious source of evil in public institutions. People's distrust of public organizations is so profound that they have little faith in their ability to collaborate with them and achieve sustainable development objectives.” ― Santosh Kalwar, Why Nepal Fails"
"“The initial function of spirituality emerged from questioning the human condition and also from deep experiences of wonder. The word religion itself, initially meaning to “reconnect,” seems to have come from direct experiences of something larger than just a set of fixed ideas. It marked a return to something essential that we just failed to recognize in the myopia of our everyday lives. How curious that we turn experiences of awe into dogmas and stagnant ideas. That we have come to associate faith with fundamentalism, blindness, and even terrorism gives us something important to look at.” ― Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel, The Logic of Faith: A Buddhist Approach to Finding Certainty Beyond Belief and Doubt"

"“Each man should be free to fight for his own salvation.” ― Lailah Gifty Akita"
"“Elva had said nothing to anyone. She prayed earnestly that she was ""all right"", explaining over and over again to God what the doctor had said, and how she couldn't properly look after the children she already had. Elva liked to pray in front of a statue similar to the one in her mother's living-room. She was not praying to the statue, but it was a kind of magical doll that kept her thoughts focussed on the Being to whom she prayed.” ― Ruth Park, Serpent's Delight"
"“If you want something, work for it. Prayer is super-fantstic, faith is 'mwah'! But work is necessary and important. So work for what you want.” ― Wisdom Kwashie Mensah, THE HONEYMOON: A SACRED AND UNFORGETTABLE SAVOUR OF A BLISSFUL MARITAL JOURNEY"

"“Through all the sorrow of the Sorrow Songs there breathes a hope—a faith in the ultimate justice of things. The minor cadences of despair change often to triumph and calm confidence. Sometimes it is faith in life, sometimes a faith in death, sometimes assurance of boundless justice in some fair world beyond. But whichever it is, the meaning is always clear: that sometime, somewhere, men will judge men by their souls and not by their skins. Is such a hope justified? Do the Sorrow Songs sing true?” ― W.E.B. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk"
"“Only 2 things determine if your life will end; God's will, and if you choose to give up. As difficult as life can get (and I know we face challenges that shake our faith and test our strength), keep in mind; you thought you'd NEVER survive the last ""thing"" you went through. Well, here you are, still living! That said giving up should no longer be an option.” ― Carlos Wallace"
"“Don't you find it interesting that people even use that term, 'act of God'? Considering that most want to believe that God is about lambs and love and babies and mangers. And yet this same so-called benevolent being smites innocent people left and right, indicating an anger management problem, maybe even manic depression. In a psychiatric ward, such a patient would be subjected to electroshock therapy.” ― Bonnie Garmus, Lessons in Chemistry"

Be just and do not fear.” ― Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Faith’s Checkbook: Daily Devotional - Promises for Today"
"“Beloved, the passage of time is but a fleeting metric, for it is the accumulation of life's experiences that truly constitutes wisdom. The years may chronicle our journey, but it is the depth of our encounters, the richness of our struggles, and the breadth of our understanding that ultimately define the substance of our being.” ― Bishop W.F.

"“But if you are not careful, spirituality can quite easily allow you to bypass the human dilemma, because spirituality can be anything you want it to be, whereas faith will challenge you. It’s not so comfortable. It carries with it the undeniable tension between your search for security and the limits of your ability to know. Faith keeps your spiritual quest relevant and connected to the heart of the human predicament.” ― Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel, The Logic of Faith: A Buddhist Approach to Finding Certainty Beyond Belief and Doubt"

"“I saw that, although they were at the mercy of the sweltering heat, or the pains of aging or poverty, they could tolerate these because their faith gave them the hope of being united in spirit with a supernatural presence. I still denied that presence. My denial, I was realizing, was my armor; it allowed me to deflect a barrage of difficult questions. But it didn't answer those questions. It protected me from charlatans, yes, but it didn't fill my emptiness or give me direction. Doubt served a purpose, but it also prevented me from trusting anyone or anything.

"“Then every man would be as a god, you see. The result of this, of course, would be that there would no longer be any gods, only men.

"“Although I'm an atheist, I try not to crap all over people's belief in God. It may be nothing more than a placebo, a fairy tale that gives the hopeless hope, but sometimes a little hope is all people need to get through the day. Imagine a unit of soldiers under heavy enemy fire. They are told by their superiors to hold their position, even in the face of overwhelming fire power. The soldiers are being told that reinforcements are on the way, and that thought alone gives them the hope and courage to continue fighting, even if ultimately the reinforcements never arrive. I think some people simply need to believe that God is sending them reinforcements, to get through another day.” ― Oliver Gaspirtz"

"“Girls aside, the other thing I found in the last few years of being at school, was a quiet, but strong Christian faith – and this touched me profoundly, setting up a relationship or faith that has followed me ever since.I am so grateful for this. It has provided me with a real anchor to my life and has been the secret strength to so many great adventures since.But it came to me very simply one day at school, aged only sixteen.As a young kid, I had always found that a faith in God was so natural. It was a simple comfort to me: unquestioning and personal.But once I went to school and was forced to sit through somewhere in the region of nine hundred dry, Latin-liturgical, chapel services, listening to stereotypical churchy people droning on, I just thought that I had got the whole faith deal wrong.Maybe God wasn’t intimate and personal but was much more like chapel was … tedious, judgemental, boring and irrelevant.The irony was that if chapel was all of those things, a real faith is the opposite. But somehow, and without much thought, I had thrown the beautiful out with the boring. If church stinks, then faith must do, too.The precious, natural, instinctive faith I had known when I was younger was tossed out with this newly found delusion that because I was growing up, it was time to ‘believe’ like a grown-up.I mean, what does a child know about faith?It took a low point at school, when my godfather, Stephen, died, to shake me into searching a bit harder to re-find this faith I had once known.Life is like that. Sometimes it takes a jolt to make us sit and remember who and what we are really about.Stephen had been my father’s best friend in the world. And he was like a second father to me. He came on all our family holidays, and spent almost every weekend down with us in the Isle of Wight in the summer, sailing with Dad and me. He died very suddenly and without warning, of a heart attack in Johannesburg.I was devastated.I remember sitting up a tree one night at school on my own, and praying the simplest, most heartfelt prayer of my life.‘Please, God, comfort me.’Blow me down … He did.My journey ever since has been trying to make sure I don’t let life or vicars or church over-complicate that simple faith I had found. And the more of the Christian faith I discover, the more I realize that, at heart, it is simple. (What a relief it has been in later life to find that there are some great church communities out there, with honest, loving friendships that help me with all of this stuff.)To me, my Christian faith is all about being held, comforted, forgiven, strengthened and loved – yet somehow that message gets lost on most of us, and we tend only to remember the religious nutters or the God of endless school assemblies.This is no one’s fault, it is just life. Our job is to stay open and gentle, so we can hear the knocking on the door of our heart when it comes.The irony is that I never meet anyone who doesn’t want to be loved or held or forgiven. Yet I meet a lot of folk who hate religion. And I so sympathize. But so did Jesus. In fact, He didn’t just sympathize, He went much further. It seems more like this Jesus came to destroy religion and to bring life.This really is the heart of what I found as a young teenager: Christ comes to make us free, to bring us life in all its fullness. He is there to forgive us where we have messed up (and who hasn’t), and to be the backbone in our being.Faith in Christ has been the great empowering presence in my life, helping me walk strong when so often I feel so weak. It is no wonder I felt I had stumbled on something remarkable that night up that tree.I had found a calling for my life.” ― Bear Grylls, Mud, Sweat and Tears"
"“Pray each morning and each night.Talk to God and be polite.Tell Him what you're grateful for.Leave your troubles at His door.Share your wishes, needs, and hopes.Ask God how to bravely cope.Tell Him all you learned today.Say the things you need to say.Beg forgiveness for your sins.Pray to live with Him again.Speak with earnest heart and soul.He will listen. This I know.For prayer is hope put to the test.And hope is faith in what is best.Faith is power to do great things.Thus, prayer is faith's enabling wings.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Making Wishes: Quotes, Thoughts, & a Little Poetry for Every Day of the Year"

"“Why do many believers insist on repeatedly pointing to the crimes of 20th century dictators who led officially atheistic societies as some sort of evidence of their god's existence? It makes no sense.If the rivers of blood on Stalin's hands and Mao's hands, for example, are supposed to prove there is a god, then what do the oceans of blood on the hands of several thousand years' worth of religious kings, queens, presidents, popes, priests, generals, Crusadersm jihadists and tribal chiefs prove? It's not, of course, but if bodycount is somehow the measure of a god's likelihood of existence, then believers lose.It is clear that humans are quite capable of killing with or without images of gods bouncing around in their heads. If anything, however, history suggests that the concept of gods makes the idea of massacring your fellow man (and women and children, too, of course) a lot easier to act upon.” ― Guy P. Harrison"

"“I was utterly convinced that an intellectual could never be anything but an intellectual, was simply not capable of being anything else, that his intellectuality would, sooner or later, erode his faith or erode whatever he'd masked it with . . .

"“I prayed to a mystery.Sometimes I was simply aware of the mystery. I saw a flash of it during a trip to New York that David and I took before we were married. We were walking on a busy sidewalk in Manhattan. I don't remember if it was day or night. A man with a wound on his forehead came toward us. His damp, ragged hair might have been clotted with blood, or maybe it was only dirt. He wore deeply dirty clothes. His red, swollen hands, cupped in half-fists, swung loosely at his sides. His eyes were focused somewhere past my right shoulder. He staggered while he walked. The sidewalk traffic flowed around him and with him. He was strange and frightening, and at the same time he belonged on the Manhattan sidewalk as much as any of us. It was that paradox -- that he could be both alien and resident, both brutalized and human, that he could stand out in the moving mass of people like a sea monster in a school of tuna and at the same time be as much at home as any of us -- that stayed with me. I never saw him again, but I remember him often, and when I do, I am aware of the mystery.Years later, I was out on our property on the Olympic Peninsula, cutting a path through the woods. This was before our house was built. After chopping through dense salal and hacking off ironwood bushes for an hour or so, I stopped, exhausted. I found myself standing motionless, intensely aware of all of the life around me, the breathing moss, the chattering birds, the living earth. I was as much a part of the woods as any millipede or cedar tree. At that moment, too, I was aware of the mystery.Sometimes I wanted to speak to this mystery directly. Out of habit, I began with ""Dear God"" and ended with ""Amen"". But I thought to myself, I'm not praying to that old man in the sky. Rather, I'm praying to this thing I can't define. It was sort of like talking into a foggy valley.Praying into a bank of fog requires alot of effort. I wanted an image to focus on when I prayed. I wanted something to pray *to*. but I couldn't go back to that old man. He was too closely associated with all I'd left behind.” ― Margaret McGee"

"“That eye which sees anything good in the creature is a blind eye; that eye which fancies it can discern anything in man, or anything in anything he can do to win the Divine favor, is as yet stone blind to the Truth of God, and needs to be lanced and cut, and the cataract of pride removed from it!” ― Charles H.

"“Yes, our Father has a plan, Ciminae,” he said. “But he leaves it up to his children to accept his will. It is their agency. He cannot force his will upon them. If he did, he would cease to be God.

"“It took a couple of months before we were both convinced there were no rules about sexual activities in Hell and our spouses were not going to show up out of the blue. It was hard to start a sexual relationship in circumstances of such bizarre uncertainty, especially for an active Mormon and a good Christian, both lost in a Zoroastrian Hell. We were like virgin newlyweds. All my life I’d been raised to believe this kind of thing was wrong. All my life I had lived with a strong sense of morality. How do you give it up? How do you do things you thought you’d never do? Where do all the things you believed go, when all the supporting structure is found to be a myth? How do you know how or on what to take a moral stand, how do you behave when it turns out there are no cosmic rules, no categorical imperatives? It was difficult. So tricky to untangle.” ― Steven L. Peck, A Short Stay in Hell"
"“Tom has been having a difficult patch, and we meet at the church of IKEA as often as possible, because it is equidistant from our houses and always cheers us up. Yesterday I asked, 'In your depression, and with so many people having such a hard time, where is Advent?' He tried to wiggle out of it by saying, 'You Protestants and your little questions!' Then, when pushed, he said: 'Faith is a decision. Do we believe we are ultimately doomed and fucked and there's no way out? Or that God and goodness make a difference? There is heaven, community, and hope - and hope that there is life beyond the grave.' 'But Tom, at the same time, the grave is very real, dark and cold and lonely.' 'Advent is not for the naive. Because in spite of the dark and cold, we see light - you look up, or you make light, with candles, or with strands of lightbulbs on trees. And you give light. Beauty helps, in art and nature and faces. Friends help. Solidarity helps. If you ask me, when people return phone calls, it's about as good as it gets. And who knows beyond that.” ― Anne Lamott"
"“He who has two grounds of trust is lost! He who relies upon twosalvations, and cannot say of Christ, “He is all my salvation and all my desire,” that man is not only in danger of beinglost, but he is already condemned; because, in fact, he believes not on the Son of God! He is not alive to God at all, but rests partly on the Cross, and then in some measure on something else.” ― Charles H. Spurgeon"
"“In the Judeo-Christian tradition, we carry forward the basic insight our fundamental relationship to the world is one of love. Christians say that “God is Love,” that God created the universe out of love. The source of God’s Creation is love, and our relationship to the possibility of meaning within this created world is in and through love. The Christian community is a reciprocal relationship among subjects who love and are loved. The subject maintains the meaning of God’s Creation by taking up a Christ-like love toward others. The appearance of meaning in the world—love’s product—is always a manifestation of the divine. Liberalism turns away from this entire tradition of thought, in party because of its association with religion, and in part because this tradition resists the analytic form of reason. For liberalism, religion is individualized and privatized, and thus it cannot be used in the explanation or justification of a public space. If it does invade the public, it threatens irrationality. But religion is no less an effort to understand the character of our experience, and even a secular philosophy must not ignore that experience. We cannot simply deny what we cannot place within our categories of analysis. (221)” ― Paul W. Kahn, Putting Liberalism in Its Place"

"“I prayed to what all things hold in common. I prayed to what makes life. I thought about the elements of the universe, the rocks, the stars, the air, other living things. I tried to get the perspective of what's behind all that. I prayed to the force that brings things into existence. I thought this force encompassed all it created. My God was transcendent, and my God was also immanent. God ran in my veins. God lived and died and lived again in every atom of the universe.” ― Margaret McGee"
"“But the witness of the substitutionary atonement of Jesus is that God's most difficult promise has been kept.” ― Sheila Walsh"
"“In my return to church, I had learned the hard way to avoid assumptions about other people's faith. For one thing, people kept surprising me. If I listened carefully to them, my conjectures about what they thought usually turned out to be wrong. For another thing, I was insecure enough about my own faith, such as it was, to resent other people telling me what they thought I believed and why they thought I believed it. So I tried to hear what my friends say about joining their loved ones after death without assuming I knew exactly what they meant.” ― Margaret McGee"
"“Science is getting knocked on all sides these days, not only from religious fundamentalists, but from all kinds of people who perceive science as arrogant, one-sided, and the source of the troubles that come with the technology it produces. It's true that individuL scientists can be so arrogant and narrowly focused, they're blind to any but their own truths, and that new discoveries bring new problems with them. Still, I don't know many people who would refuse a biopsy for a newly discovered lump because they think science needs to be taken down a peg or two.Religion gets knocked for the same kinds of reasons as science: for its arrogance, narowmindedness, and tendency to create more trouble than it's worth. Religion is also accused of concealing reality under a comforting blanket of measureless faith -- the flip side, perhaps of the scientist for whom nothing can be real until she has measured it.My own sojourn into religion convinced me that good religion reveals rather than conceals. Religion is the soul in search of itself and its relationship to the cosmos. This journey requires looking at all of it: the joy, the sorrow, the beauty and the horror of life. We hope for the best. We want meaning and love to exist not only in ourselves, but in the very soul of the universe. At times this great hope might tempt us to pick and choose only the data that supports our desires. But in religion as in boat-building, the design must be tested in all conditions. When I say that I'm trying to pay attention, and that paying attention means being willing to look at all of it, I think I'm trying for the same moment of clarity that Graham experienced when the wind blew all over his theory. Looking at all of it is what good science is about. I believe that it's also what good religion is about.” ― Margaret McGee"

He said,'Just as there exists in writing a literal truth and a poetic truth, there also exists in a human being a literal anatomy and a poetic anatomy. One, you can see; one, you cannot.

They knew the buyer man would get much more, but they didn't know how to do it. Merchandising was a secret to them.” ― John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath"
"“I would rather believe God doesn't exist than believe he doesn't care.” ― Eric Wilson, Expiration Date"
"“Why God should want and need us is a mystery. But it is true: otherwise he would not have created us and life would ultimately have no meaning for us. It is good to remember that in God the is a constancy, a consistency of attitude which never changes, irrespective of what we are or how we act: he never changes in is wanting us or needing us.” ― Cardinal Basil Hume, Searching for God"
"“In addition to the kind of critical reflection on one's previous assumptive or tacit system of values we saw Jack undertake, there must be, for Stage 4, a relocation of authority within the self. While others and their judgments will remain important to the Individuative-Reflective person, their expectations, advice and counsel will be submitted to an internal panel of experts who reserve the right to choose and who are prepared to take responsibility for their choices. I sometimes call this the emergence of the executive ego. The two essential features of the emergence of Stage 4, then, are the critical distancing from one's previous assumptive value system and the emergence of the executive ego. . . . We find that sometimes many persons complete half of this double movement, but do not complete the other.” ― James W. Fowler, Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning"
"“It seems all spirits need theatrics, eh? Even Christ himself requires incense and holy water. We're a skeptical people. We need convincing.” ― Megan Chance, The Spiritualist"
"“What a failure her life had been. Would she have lied to God if she’d had more faith, been more righteous? How could she possibly have a son at her age? And yet, if she had believed all along . . .” ― Jill Eileen Smith, Sarai"
"“Науката казва докажи ми и ще повярвам, а вярата казва повярвай и ще ти докажа!” ― Схиархимандрит Касиан"
"“That was one of the inherent flaws of faith. Belief without knowing. But worse yet: belief without action. It could be good in its own right. Beautiful, even, when embraced, but that had to be measured. Checked. Too many surrendered themselves to it. What they did not see was simple fact. Religion did not bring peace. It merely offered a means. It was up to man to create peace.” ― Chris Galford, The Hollow March"
"“A belief which leaves no place for doubt is not a belief; it is a superstition. -Jose Bergamin, author (1895-1983)” ― Jose Bergamin"
"“There’s faith that knows itself as faith, Proyas, and there’s faith that confuses itself for knowledge. The first embraces uncertainty, acknowledges the mysteriousness of the God. It begets compassion and tolerance. Who can entirely condemn when they’re not entirely certain they’re in the right? But the second, Proyas, the second embraces certainty and only pays lip service to the God’s mystery. It begets intolerance, hatred, violence.” ― R. Scott Bakker, The Darkness That Comes Before"
"“If you believed in Christianity or Islam it was called 'faith', but if you believed in astrology or friday the thirteenth it was Superstition!” ― Jostein Gaarder, Sophie’s World"
"“Have faith little one ‘til your hopes and your wishes come true. You must try to be brave.” ― The Rescuers"
"“A strong, vague persuasion that it was better to go forward than backward, and that I could go forward— that a way, however narrow and difficult, would in time open— predominated over other feelings: its influence hushed them so far, that at last I became sufficiently tranquil to be able to say my prayers and seek my couch. I had just extinguished my candle and lain down, when a deep, low, mighty tone swung through the night. At first I knew it not; but it was uttered twelve times, and at the twelfth colossal hum and trembling knell, I said: “I lie in the shadow of St. Paul’s.” ― Charlotte Brontë, Villette"
"“I am not functioning very well. Living with the knowledge that the baby is dead is painful. I feel so far away from you, God. I can only try to believe that you are sustaining me and guiding me through this. Please continue to stand by my side.” ― Christine O'Keeffe Lafser, An Empty Cradle, a Full Heart: Reflections for Mothers and Fathers After Miscarriage, Stillbirth, or Infant Death"
"“Fear is the lack of faith in one's ability to create powerful solutions.” ― T.F. Hodge, From Within I Rise: Spiritual Triumph over Death and Conscious Encounters With the Divine Presence"

"“Yes, she believed God loved her. But if this whole fiasco was His idea of love . . .” ― Lauraine Snelling, Valley of Dreams"
"“Os ventos do destino são imutáveis.” ― Susana Almeida, Sombras de Morte"
"“As your faith is strengthened, you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control, that things will flow as they will and that you will flow with them to your great delight and benefit.” ― Emmanuel Teney"
"“Watching you has taught me that a man need not be weak to have a faith, but is made strong by it.” ― Roseanna White, A Stray Drop of Blood"
"“The average man has no central core of moral assurance, no spring within his breast, no inner strength to place him above the need for repeated psychological shots to give him the courage to go on living. He has become a parasite on the world, drawing his life from his environment, unable to live a day apart from the stimulation which society affords him.” ― A.W. Tozer"
"“[Faith] was something other than an intellectual exercise. There were no words, no lofty concepts, that could take away the pain. Faith was living with the pain.” ― Margaret Coel, The Eagle Catcher"
"“Eres mío para jugar contigo a mi antojo” ― Nalini Singh, Visions of Heat"
"“There is a beauty in paradox when it comes to talking about things of ultimate concern. Paradox works against our tendency to stay superficial in our faith, or to rest on easy answers or categorical thinking. It breaks apart our categories by showing the inadequacy of them and by pointing to a reality larger than us, the reality of gloria, of light, of beyond-the-beyond. I like to call it paradoxology—the glory of paradox, paradox-doxology—which takes us somewhere we wouldn’t be capable of going if we thought we had everything all wrapped up, if we thought we had attained full comprehension. The commitment to embracing the paradox and resisting the impulse to categorize people (ourselves included) is one of the ways we follow Jesus into that larger mysterious reality of light and love.” ― Nanette Sawyer"
"“Levi,"" Maria called. ""Come back. We're not finished yet.""He paused""What, Maria?""""You asked me what I believe in? I believed in you.""He nodded his head sadly. ""Yes, you did. And before you met me, you believed in nothing. But that's the thing with belief, Maria. It's easy to believe in something when it doesn't require anything from you. It's much harder, though, when the object of your belief requires something of you or asks for something you don't want to give. That's when real belief occurs.” ― Brian Keene, Ghost Walk"
"“I loved my father, but I was not like him. I never needed to believe the best of people. I took them as they were: two-faced, desperate, kind - perhaps all at once. But to Pa, they were all children of god, poor troubled sheep, who only needed love and an even break. He needed the world to back up what his religion told him about people. And when it came down to a choice between reason and faith, he let go of reason.” ― Marcel Theroux, Far North"
"“The daily circumstances of life will afford us opportunities enough of glorifying God in trust, without our waiting for any extraordinary calls upon faith, our faith. Let us remember that the extraordinary circumstances of life are but few; that much of life may slip past without their occurrence; and that if we be not faithful and trusting in that which is little, we are not likely to be so in that which is great... Let our trust be reared in the humble nursery of our own daily experience, with its ever recurring little wants and trials, and sorrows; and then, when need be, it will come forth, to do such great things as are required of it.” ― Philip Bennett Power"
"“Solo mirarte me proporciona el placer más intenso que jamás haya sentido.” ― Nalini Singh, Visions of Heat"
"“Keep marching boys and girls. Keep marching” ― Rodman Philbrick, The Mostly True Adventures of Homer P. Figg"
"“You were born into this life equipped to succeed. You are a part of God’s perfect plan. Yes, you. The plan would not be perfect if you were missing. Think about that. You matter more than you know.” ― Toni Sorenson"
"“We all reach a point that is the limit of our understanding. When we stare over the precipice of uncertainty and into the dark unknown that we cannot explain with hard evidence, that is when we trade understanding for belief. At best, we make an educated guess. At worst, we make blind leaps of faith.” ― Ramsey Isler, The Ninth Order"
"“We are in God’s hands. We can’t come up with a surprise big enough or a sin vile enough to thwart His plan. If we allow Him to refine us we will inevitably end up free from the impurities that separate us from Him.” ― Toni Sorenson"
"“It took more than science to make hope real.” ― Dr. Jerome Groopman"
"“No human mind can fully grasp the gift of Christ’s atonement, the vastness and inclusiveness of the act—but in the end, it comes down to just you and Jesus. You’ve come, and He’s met you with open arms—and now it’s just between the two of you.” ― Toni Sorenson"
"“God is merciful cant we all be on the right track of faith but just using different roads?” ― Ali Al-Ahmed"
"“He who asserts belief with absolute certainty knows nothing of faith and makes himself into a fool. He who is wise, upon realizing they have done this, recants and searches themselves for further enlightenment.” ― Cristina Marrero"
"“Just as He had been doing even before the moment I consciously embarked on this journey, He revealed to me that it was all about love. It always has been—before the foundations of the earth—and it always will be—throughout eternity. The answers I was seeking were found in love, the healing I desperately needed also found in love. The love I sought and so desperately wanted to give was enabled, empowered, and actualized by His divine love. So nothing remains but for me to LOVE as an expression of my appreciation for His love for me: L-live an O-openly V-virtuous E-existence.” ― Riisa Renee"
"“Molitveni jezik jedini je jezik u kojem nema jezičnih zabrana. Kako je već rečeno, on je obuhvatniji od jezika vjere koja je sigurna u samu sebe. U jeziku molitve može se naime reći i to da se ne može vjerovati.” ― Johann Baptist Metz, Memoria passionis: Ein provozierendes Gedächtnis in pluralistischer Gesellschaft"
"“Ние строим духовно пречиствателна станция.” ― Схиархимандрит Касиан"
"“faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts... [you] still experience the same greed, resentment, lust, and anger that everyone else experienced... the lines between sinner and saved [are] more fluid; the sins of those who come to church are not so different from the sins of those who don't... You [need] to come to church precisely because you [are] of this world, not apart from it; rich, poor, sinner, saved you [need] to embrace Christ precisely because you had sins to wash away... that religious commitment did not require me to suspend critical thinking, disengage from the battle for economic and social justice, or otherwise retreat from the world...” ― Barack Obama, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream"
"“Faith belongs to the human spirit. Faith is faith. Humanity is divided by religion, religion is the divider of humanity. If every human could be removed of their blindfolds and see that faith is in itself faith and that this is something which belongs to each and every human being, then at that time the dividers of religion will suddenly mean nothing and we will all see that we are united by faith in and of itself. There is only one faith and it is called faith. And no man needs to prove to another man that what he believes in exists, because even if it does not exist, his faith is his belief that it is there, that something is there, and that in itself is faith. So I do not need to prove to any man that what I believe in exists or not, there is no such contest between man, my faith breathes in the body of my belief; the fact that I believe is the breath of my faith.” ― C. JoyBell C."
"“No coward soul is mine,No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere:I see heaven's glories shine,And faith shines equal, arming me from fear” ― Emily Brontë"
"“Every time we turn to Christ in faith it is like a moment of Sabbath, a little foretaste of eternal rest and glory. The gift of that moment lies not in what we do but what we receive. It is the holy time set aside to receive the greatest gift of God ever has to give, which is himself, in his own beloved Son.” ― Phillip Cary, Good News for Anxious Christians: 10 Practical Things You Don't Have to Do"
"“Many things the gods achieve beyond our judgement,'"" said the sorrowful girl. ""'What we thought is not confirmed and what we thought not God contives.” ― John Irving, A Prayer for Owen Meany"
"“Oh, sometimes I like to put the sand of doubt into the oyster of my faith."" (Br. Cadfael)” ― Ellis Peters, The Leper of Saint Giles"
"“I still find my corrupt heart longing for tomorrow's bread. I can make a good argument to the Lord about how effective I can be if He would supply me with enough advance funds. It's a little frightening to pray for TODAY's bread. That means I must pray again for tomorrow and believe again for tomorrow. My greedy heart is willing to be corrupted by a little bit of riches so that I see my warehouse full of loaves. I can make a good argument about how God won’t have to be bothered with me every day if He would only advance me about ten years worth of bread.” ― Gayle Erwin, The YHWH Style: A Fresh Look at the Nature of God the Father"
"“Fear is the ghost of ancient.It consumes faithless human.” ― Toba Beta, My Ancestor Was an Ancient Astronaut"
"“In the beginning, the call of God was not propositional. It was experiential. (p. 10)” ― Robin R. Meyers, Saving Jesus from the Church: How to Stop Worshiping Christ and Start Following Jesus"
"“The cure for our modern maladies is dirt under the fingernails and the feel of thick grass between the toes. The cure for our listlessness is to be out within the invigorating wind. The cure for our uselessness is to take back up our stewardship; for it is not that there has been no work to be done, we simply have not been attending to it.” ― L.M. Browning, Ruminations at Twilight: Poetry Exploring the Sacred"
"“Japan likewise put her hopes of victory on a different basis from that prevalent in the United States. (...) Even when she was winning, her civilian statesmen, her High Command, and her soldiers repeated that this was no contest between armaments; it was pitting of our faith in things against their faith in spirit.” ― Ruth Benedict, Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture"
"“And whose rules will choose to you follow? God's? Or man's? You say you want to break the outmoded patterns and crate a new model? Then do it. That is part of your destiny, boy.” ― Kathleen McGowan, The Poet Prince"
"“In this nonfundamentalist understanding of faith, practice is more important than theory, love more important than law, and mystery is seen as an insight into truth rather than an obstacle. It is the great lie of our time that all religious faith has to be fundamentalist to be valid.” ― Andrew Sullivan"
"“Religion consists much in holy affection; but those exercises of affection which are most distinguishing of true religion are these practical exercises. Friendship between earthly friends consists much in affection; but those strong exercises of affection that actually carry them through fire and water for each other are the highest evidences of true friendship.” ― Jonathan Edwards, The Religious Affections"
"“Вера в себя способна творить такие же чудеса, как вера в Господа Бога.” ― Honoré de Balzac, Béatrix"
"“These early Saints were indeed homeless, but they were not hopeless. Their hearts were broken, but their spirits were strong. They had learned a profound and important lesson. They had learned that hope, with its attendant blessings of peace and joy, does not depend upon circumstance. They had discovered that the true source of hope is faith—faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in His infinite Atonement, the one sure foundation upon which to build our lives.” ― Elder Wilford W. Andersen"

"“I believe in study. I believe that men learn much through study. As a matter of fact, it has been my observationthat they learn little concerning things as they are, as they were, or as they are to come without study. I alsobelieve, however, and know, that learning by study is greatly accelerated by faith.” ― Marion G. Romney"
"“(from the short story The Honorary Shepherds)...you can't be kicked out of a faith. Faith starts inside your heart and ends up in eternity. All you can be kicked out of is a building, which is the bus stop of faith, sort of, and what's a building?” ― Gregory Maguire, Am I Blue?: Coming Out from the Silence"
"“Darkness entered into, darkness realized, is the point of departure for all profound expressions of Christian hope. 'Meaningless darkness' becomes 'revelatory darkness' when it is confronted by the courage of a thoughtfulness and hope that is born of faith's quest for truth.” ― Douglas John Hall, Imaging God: Dominion as Stewardship"
"“Sophie Bach from The Maker:You’re a human being with a personality and a will, and you make choices and think and create. Is there no meaning to you, Adrien Bach?And what about us?

"“In that moment, I understand the way that the noblest yearning for duty and sacrifice can be mixed up with all that is savage and shameful, like in the Bible, where a just and merciful God tells you to kill everyone, kill the children, kill the livestock, kill John Polling, leave nothing alive to sully this pure and just world. Except when it's all done you find out that wasn't really God after all, just some politician, or maybe it was God, but he taps you on the shoulder and says, 'No, dude, that isn't what I meant,' and leaves you sitting in a Dairy Queen in Bothell with blood on your hands and no further orders...” ― Stuart Archer Cohen, The Army of the Republic"
"“Nou, Stanley Donne legde ons uit dat alle godsdiensten ter wereld, occulte broederschappen, alle mystici en sjamanen, of het nu Rozenkruisers, Ridders van de Ronde Tafel, Egyptische hogepriesters, Tibetaanse boeddhistishce monniken, Zuid-Amerikaanse naguals, Indiase yogi's, Keltische druïden of discipelen van Jezus waren, allemaal hetzelfde doel nastreefden, namelijk om het bewustzijn van het individu dusdanig te vergroten en te verheffen dat hij of zij uiteindelijk tot een kosmisch bewustzijn komt en toetreedt tot hogere dimensies.” ― Tim Ray, De gelofte"

"“Be true, unbeliever.” ― Stephen R. Donaldson, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever"
"“His spells portrayed the spirit as a frail thing, contstantly under attack and in need of stength, always threatening to die inside you. Inman found this notion dismal indeed, since he had been taught by sermon and hymn to hold as truth that the soul of man never dies.” ― Charles Frazier, Cold Mountain"
"“When I think of the Crucifixion, I commit the sin of envy.” ― Simone Weil, Waiting for God"
"“What about you, Snipes?"" Dunbar asked. ""You think there to be mountain lions up here or is it just folks' imaginings?""Snipes pondered the question a few moments before speaking.They's many a man of science would claim there aint because you got no irredeemable evidence like panther scat or fur or tooth or tail. In other words, some part of the animal in questions. Or better yet having the actual critter itself, the whole think kit and caboodle head to tail, which all your men of science argue is the best proof of all a thing exists, whether it be a panther, or a bird, or even a dinosaur.""To put it another way, if you was to stub your toe and tell the man of science what happened he'd not believe a word of it less he could see how it'd stoved up or was bleeding. But your philosophers and theologians and such say there’s things in the world that’s every bit as real even though you can’t see them.”Like what?” Dunbar asked.Well,” Snipes said. “They’s love, that’s one. And courage. You can’t see neither of them, but they’re real. And air, of course. That’s one of your most important examples. You wouldn’t be alive a minute if there wasn’t air, but nobody’s ever seen a single speck of it.”… “All I’m saying is there is a lot more to this old world than meets the eye.”… “And darkness. You can’t see it no more than you can see air, but when its all around you sure enough know it.” (Serena, 65-66)” ― Ron Rash"

"“The South African artist William Kentridge speaks to this type of certainty: 'To say that one needs art, or politics, that incorporate ambiguity and contradiction is not to say that one then stops recognizing and condemning things as evil. However, it might stop one being so utterly convinced of the certainty of one's own solutions. There needs to be a strong understanding of fallibility and how the very act of certainty or authoritativeness can bring disasters.'The outcome of the current crisis is already determined.” ― Nick Flynn, The Ticking Is the Bomb: A Memoir"

"“Coming from a Hindu family, I struggled immensely with the institutionalized aspects of the faith; staring at the idols often made me feel a sense of intense discomfort.” ― Sajal Garg, Glimpses of My Worldview"
"“We must not overlook the connection between faith and love. The woman saw Jesus and recognised who he was and who dwelt in him. That Vision was her faith. She knew he was forgiving and accepting her before he ever said, “Your sins are forgiven.” She knew because she had seen a goodness in him that could only be God, and it broke her heart with gratitude and love.Speaking in the language of today, we would say she went “nuts” about Jesus. Her behavior obviously was the behavior of a “nutty” person. (We really do have to use colloquial language to capture responses to Jesus. More formal, literary, or theological language cannot do it.) When we see Jesus as he is, we must turn away or else shamelessly adore him.”⠀” ― Dallas Willard, The Divine Conspiracy: Rediscovering Our Hidden Life in God"

"“To a loner it hardly seems possible-not even plausible- that millions could agree on what God likes and dislikes and whether pork or beef is verboten. How, we muse, can millions nod in unison approving the validity of liturgy? How can the unseen move so many strangers in the exact same way? Those millions-nonloners, of course- would say it moves them alike because it is real. They would say the unanimity by which it moves them proves it is real. Loners cannot help but suspect something else afoot, something pedestrian. We know nonloners learn by imitation. We know they shore up their self-esteem through imitation, through securing a sense of belonging. Nonloners thrive on this, so why would it not tint their view of heaven? Among nonloners, religion fends off loneliness, one of their greatest fears, both within the soul and without.” ― Anneli Rufus, Party of One: The Loner's Manifesto"

"“Some Christians have been taught to suppress their emotions as they sing. They've been told to fear feeling anything too strongly, and that maturity means holding back. But what we want to avoid is 'emotionalism', not 'emotions'. Emotionalism pursues feelings as an end in themselves. It's wanting to feel something with no regard to how that feeling is produced or its ultimate purpose.In contrast, the emotions that singing is meant to express are a response to who God is and what he's done. Vibrant singing allows us to combine truth 'about' God seamlessly with passion 'for' God. Doctrine and devotion. Mind and heart. Suppressing or ignoring your feelings when you sing contradicts what singing is designed to do. Passionless singing is an oxymoron.” ― Bob Kauflin, True Worshipers: Seeking What Matters to God"

In that surrender, there is profound peace. What the Sustainer chooses for us carries wisdom, even when it does not align with our own plans” ― Ajmal, from the book ""Borders of the Inner World"""
"“Reverence begins here, in humility. It begins when we remember that even our breath is borrowed, that each dawn is gifted, that our entire being is held in divine mercy. To live with reverence is to see traces of the Creator in everything.” ― Ajmal, from the book ""Borders of the Inner World"""
"“I clock countless hours in the gym, where log thousands of reps and run and ride my bike obscene distances, to cultivate believe, Despite what you may think, I don't consider myself an ultra-athlete because those races are not who I am. They are tools. Each one provides me a stockpile of faith so when I get stuck in the maze of life like a broke-down savage, I still believe I am capable of achieving my unreasonable goals, such as becoming a smokejumper at forty-seven years old, no matter what society or the good doctors say.” ― David Goggins, Never Finished: Unshackle Your Mind and Win the War Within"
"“Is it worth taking a risk?Sometimes the comfort zone is more dangerous than the risk itself. It feels safe, but it quietly holds you back from growing. Life starts to change when you stop letting fear decide your direction and choose to take the first step forward.When you trust that Allah is the best of planners, uncertainty becomes part of the journey, not the obstacle. Faith is not about waiting for everything to be clear. It is about moving with trust, even when the path ahead is not fully visible.” ― Abdul Wahid Sarguroh"

"“This, then, is the job ahead. It is the job of building broad, deep People’s Organizations which are all-inclusive of both the people and their many organizations. It is the job of uniting, through a common interest which far transcends individual differences, all the institutions and agencies representative of the people. It is the job of building a People's Organization so that people will have faith in themselves and in their fellow men. It is the job of educating our people so that they will be informed to the point of being able to exercise an intelligent critical choice as to what is true and what is false. It is the job of instilling confidence in men so that they are sure they can destroy all of the evils which afflict them and their fellows, whether unemployment, war, or other man-made disasters. It is the greatest job man could have — the actual opportunity of creating and building a world of decency, dignity, peace, security, happiness; a world worthy of man and worthy of the name of civilization. This is the job ahead.The building of these People's Organizations and the achievement of popular participation cannot and will not be done by denouncing the present deplorable condition of democracy. It will not be done by wailing self-recriminations. It can be done only by setting ourselves to the dirty, monotonous, heart-breaking job of building People’s Organizations. It can be done only by possessing the infinite patience and faith to hang on as parts of the organization disintegrate; to rebuild, add on, and continue to build.It can be done only by those who believe in, have faith in, and are willing to make every sacrifice for the people. Those who see fearlessly and clearly; they will be your radicals. The radical will look squarely at all issues. He will not be so weighted down with material or malignant prejudice that he can only look upward with a worm’s-eye view. He will not look down upon mankind with the distorted, unrealistic, ivory-tower bird’s-eye view, but will look straight ahead on the dead level, seeing man as a man. Not from a long distance, up or down, but as a man living among men.” ― Saul D. Alinsky, Reveille for Radicals"

In a political vacuum we become increasingly vulnerable to a seizure from the far right. We know that the Snake is there but we are as paralyzed as the Rabbit. People are not rabbits, and America must shake off this nightmare and awake again. The middle classes must be organized for action, for claiming their rights and powers of citizenship in a free society. The organization must be committed to the values of a free and open society. The middle classes must begin to participate as citizens for those ideals which give meaning and purpose to life.Logic and faith go together as the opposite sides of the same shield. We know by our intelligence the greatness and desirability of a free and open society over all other alternatives. Logic tells us, ""We'll believe it when we see it."" But there is also the converse, faith. Faith, or belief in the people, tells us, ""We'll see it when we believe it.""” ― Saul D. Alinsky, Reveille for Radicals"

"“By taking the risk, you give yourself the chance to succeed. By allowing yourself this opportunity, regardless of the outcome, you give that thing permission to enter your life. But by giving up and accepting from the very beginning that you can’t do it, it’s the same as trying and failing; you will lose either way.” ― Cosmina Movilescu, Light Beings: Heaven’s Guide to Self-Realization, of the Spirit, in the Physical World"
"“Stories carry truth deeper than words alone ever could.” ― Abby Salinas"
"“Maybe he showed up because I needed him, not just for play, but to shield me from another voice entirely. Maybe Colonel O'Truth was a product of protection from the terrifying God I encountered at the Catholic church in the form of statues and crucifixes, or the stories my grandmother and mother were always telling me about how He was going to punish me if I misbehaved. Regardless of where he came from, the Colonel was a comforting voice.” ― John S. Johnson, Breaking Building Belonging: Why the Voices We Follow Matter"
"“The pious man knows nothing of a holy Catholic Church, whose world-embracing power other expositors prefer to contrast with the limited conventicles of the heretics. He only knows a holy Christianity whose goods consist in our becoming children of God, brothers of Jesus Christ, disciples of the Holy Spirit and comrades of the apostles. The article on eternal life fills us with hope and longing for the hereafter, protects us from the sorrows of this life and makes us willing to part from it. With the Amen, however, we surrender ourselves to God’s will to want what he wants from us.” ― Friedrich Wiegand, Das apostolische Symbol im Mittelalter: Eine Skizze (Vorträge der Theologischen Konferenz zu Giessen, 21)"

"“Of all the many aspects of being a priest, Gabriel had always loved this part the most - trying to establish a connection between God and the everyday lives of his faithful. He felt that if he could do that - keep it relevant, bring God beyond the doors of his church - then perhaps he would have left something positive behind.” ― Neil Abramson, Just Life"
"“You want to see God? Look closely and without blinking into the faces of the forgotten, the frightened, and the unforgiven. Bear witness. Get down on your knees with them, spend time in their presence, hear their stories however they are told. Otherwise it is far too easy to believe they deserve their hell.” ― Neil Abramson, Just Life"
"“This may sound ironic, but I don't believe in miracles. Or, even if they do exist, that I'm worthy of one. I've prayed every day since I found out that God would take me into His house before another sunrise. But I guess sometimes God's greatest gift is an unanswered prayer. If He had taken me, these creatures would not have found sanctuary, even if it is perhaps just for a day. Eliot would have been dead on some cold metal table, and you, my friend... would have been denied the opportunity to pull my head out of my ass.” ― Neil Abramson, Just Life"

"“Right to leave religion is just as fundamental as right to religion.” ― Abhijit Naskar, Iftar-e Insaniyat: The First Supper"
"“But before examining this point [the third Meditation: 'the Existence of God'] more carefully and investigating other truths which may be derived from it, I should like to pause here and spend some time in the contemplation of God; to reflect on his attributes, and to gaze with wonder and adoration on the beauty of this immense light, so far as the eye of my darkened intellect can bear it. For just as we believe through faith that the supreme happiness of the next life consists solely in the contemplation of the divine majesty, so experience tells us that this same contemplation, albeit much less perfect, enables us to know the greatest joy of which we are capable of in this life.” ― René Descartes"
"“The most divine strategy is not one of intricate plans, but of profound principles that guide every decision.""""The most pressing challenges of modern leadership have answers thousands of years old, waiting in stories of faith, failure, and resilience.""""When the 'why' of your work is purpose, the 'how' of your work finds its integrity.” ― I G Sambandam"
"“How to tell a human from ape, when both look the same? Look for the creature that considers everyone outside their religion a heathen, and everyone outside their culture a heretic - that's a textbook ape. Now look for the being that finds the same human spirit in every culture, religion and nation - that right there, is a rare human specimen.” ― Abhijit Naskar, Iftar-e Insaniyat: The First Supper"

"“I am declaring an era of divine surplus where scarcity is silenced. In this season,” says the Lord, “I am not just meeting needs — I am rewriting what 'need' means. Your storehouses shall echo with abundance before you even know they’re empty. I am sowing breakthroughs inside your declarations; speak, and you’ll unlock what I’ve already loaded into your atmosphere. This is the hour where surplus becomes strategy, and faith becomes your funnel. I am commanding the winds of overflow to be your servants — not your signals.” ― Dr. Angela L. Hood"
"“This season carries a frequency unfamiliar to history,” says the Lord. “I am orchestrating alignments that make no earthly sense but unlock heavenly strategies. You won’t echo past victories — you will originate patterns that rewrite testimony. I’ve assigned favor to follow your footsteps like a shadow, not to remind you of yesterday, but to prove that glory goes where obedience walks. Watch how I weaponize your rest — even silence will thunder with deliverance.” ― Dr. Angela L. Hood"

"“Life will sometimes have mountains that you will have to climb again and again. Some of those mountains will challenge your faith.

Trust your Maker, and He will grant you the victory to keep the enemy at bay.” ― Gift Gugu Mona, A Manual for Victory"
"“Victorious people always tap into the realm of miracles, because they hold onto their faith until God makes a way.” ― Gift Gugu Mona, A Manual for Victory"
"“When considering -the- event of history, namely the incarnation, Kierkegaard does not de-historicize this event to make faith more palatable to a sophisticated modern audience. Instead, employing contemporaneity he accentuates the historicity of the event, and then identifies our response to it as -either- faith -or- offence. In this way coming to have faith, and thus becoming a whole, authentic person, is essentially and inextricably tied up with the attitude towards an historical event.” ― Stephen Backhouse, Kierkegaard's Critique of Christian Nationalism"

"“From the Lord above, I’ve learned that there is consequence in the desire to love. To surrender to another is like being lost at sea, drifting toward a shore lined with travesty. Faith, like a compass, points us to the moments we are meant to share on this journey.” ― Constantine Rhaich'al"
"“This family is bound through truth and trials, the loves that compass our life, for in forgiveness, we overcome the refuge of bitterness and lies. We are sustained by compassion, and we will endure as the sun’s fusion core churns, and the darkness flees from its majesty thrown across the solar system’s expanse. It is the mysterious fusion in love that gives us our strength and powers us so.” ― Constantine Rhaich'al, Through Shadows and Light: Myths of Families and Love"
"“Scripture is a record of the same story, told again and again, in different ways but always with the same theme, for more than three thousand years. God loves man. Man betrays God. Then God calls man back to his friendship. Sometimes that call involves some very painful suffering, and for good reason. God respects our freedom. But he will not interfere with our choices or their consequences, no matter how unpleasant. As a result, the struggle in the human heart between good and evil-- a struggle that seems burned into our chromosomes-- projects itself onto the world, to ennoble or deform it. The beauty and the barbarism we inflict on one another leave their mark on creation.” ― Archbishop Charles J. Chaput"

"“So often in our earliest iterations of faith, we might categorize God as angry in the Old Testament and gracious in the New Testament. We can often drift toward binary terms, black and white, good or bad, angry or kind.

They hit us so much that we no longer felt the pain of the punch. There was something bigger at work protecting us, something beyond our capabilities, and that kept us alive without losing our minds.

"“After so many years of interrogations, I had learned that praying and reciting the Qur'an completely shut off all my senses so that I didn't hear, I didn't see, I didn't feel anymore. I just existed in the moment but outside the moment. Interrogators could talk for hours. They could do all kinds of horrible humiliating things to me and they did. But it didn't matter anymore.” ― Mansoor Adayfi, Don't Forget Us Here: Lost and Found at Guantanamo"

Little hummingbirds stuck their needle beaks right through her headcloth into her hair and beat their wings. And if she thought anything it was No. No. Nono. Nonono. Simple. Se just flew. Collected every bit of life she had made, all the parts of her that were precious and fine and beautiful, and carried, pushed, dragged them through the veil, out, away, over there where no one could hurt the. Over there. Outside this place, where they would be safe. And the hummingbird wings beat on.” ― Toni Morrison, Beloved"

"“The work was mind numbing yet somehow important. I was a tiny contributor to a large thing, bringing my offering under the watchful gaze of Almighty God. Chasing dust motes wasn’t as poetic as the gift of the little drummer boy, but it was the gift I had at the moment. I’m not sure what the elders would think of my musings.Daddy had always said the people were the church, but with it all empty and lemon-fresh scented, it felt more holy than it did on the usual Sunday, when it was full of powdery-cheeked ladies and men wearing suits. The quietness soothed me more than any choir. The stillness let me focus and actually see the play of light on stained glass windows.Without light, the windows would be as blank and lifeless as plain old regular, unsanctified panes.” ― Donna Jo Stone, When the Wildflowers Bloom Again"
"“Sometimes we make good choices. Sometimes we make bad ones, but we are not defined by our mistakes.” Her steady gaze, so much like Daddy’s, never left mine. “When I look at you I see so much more.”Something shifted deep inside me and a pang shot through my stomach.“But you don’t know,” I choked out.Aunt Sister squeezed my arm. “I know you, Mary.”I expected her to repeat the phrases I’d so often heard about how God knows everything and loves you anyway. But she didn’t. I guess she figured I already knew.I did.Sister reminded me without saying a word. I just wasn’t sure I completely believed it anymore.” ― Donna Jo Stone, When the Wildflowers Bloom Again"

Then we ask, “Where is the growth?” This cultural age we are in is obsessed with information and followers and online presence.

And we were made for glory.” ― Russ Ramsey, Rembrandt is in the Wind: Learning to Love Art through the Eyes of Faith"
"“For it is a fact that the more unbelievers pour scorn on Him, so much the more does He make His Godhead evident. The things which they, as men, rule out as impossible, He plainly shows to be possible; that which they deride as unfitting, His goodness makes most fit; and things which these wiseacres laugh at as ""human"" He by His inherent might declares divine. Thus by what seems His utter poverty and weakness on the cross He overturns the pomp and parade of idols, and quietly and hiddenly wins over the mockers and unbelievers to recognize Him as God.” ― Athanasius of Alexandria"
"“Just as there is no place where God is not, there is no state where saintliness cannot find a place. Whether anchorites or wanderers, princes who retreat to the desert, merchants who abandon their shops and go begging by the roadside, there is in Islam no lack of vocations which take their impulse from renunciation and find their fulfilment in exile. But perfection does not come from these ruptures. The best stay where they are, since ""He is with you wherever you are"". They do not flee their condition, be they caliph or water bearer; sometimes it is their condition which flees them. Their retreat is the crowd, their desert is the public square.

"“By bearing each other’s burdens, we “fulfil the law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2; see also Mosiah 18:8). Jesus taught, “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). Can it be that in our search for joy, the best way to find it is to bring joy to others? My friends, you know and I know this is true! Joy is like a barrel of flour or a jar of oil that will never run out (see 1 Kings 17:8–16). True joy multiplies when it is shared.It doesn’t require something grand or complicated.We can do simple things.Like praying for someone with all our heart.Giving a sincere compliment.Helping someone feel welcome, respected, valued, and loved.Sharing a favorite scripture and what it means to us.Or even just by listening.“When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17).” ― Dieter F.

"“Faith, hope, and charity complement each other, and as one increases, the others grow as well. Hope comes of faith (see Ether 12:4), for without faith, there is no hope (see Moroni 7:42). In like manner, faith comes of hope, for faith is “the substance of things hoped for” (Hebrews 11:1).Hope is critical to both faith and charity. When disobedience, disappointment, and procrastination erode faith, hope is there to uphold our faith. When frustration and impatience challenge charity, hope braces our resolve and urges us to care for our neighbors even without expectation of reward. The brighter our hope, the greater our faith. The stronger our hope, the purer our charity.The things we hope for lead us to faith, while the things we hope in lead us to charity.” ― Dieter F. Uchtdorf"

By itself, life can only have existence, but resurrection can withstand any kind of attack, even the attack of death. The Lord is not only life, but He is also resurrection. Death cannot hold Him because He can conquer death. Death cannot retain Him, because He is not only life—He is also resurrection. Life is the power to exist, but resurrection is the power to conquer everything that is against life...We must learn how to apply this resurrection life day by day. We must not only live by the Lord as life, but we must also conquer by the Lord as resurrection...Regardless of the pressure or trouble we are bearing, we can stand it because we have resurrection life.” ― Witness Lee, Life-Study of John"

"“In any event, even if one’s concept of rationality or of what constitutes a science is too constricted to recognize the contemplative path for what it is, the essential point remains: no matter what one’s private beliefs may be, any attempt to confirm or disprove the reality of God can be meaningfully undertaken only in a way appropriate to what God is purported to be. If one imagines that God is some discrete object visible to physics or some finite aspect of nature, rather than the transcendent actuality of all things and all-knowing, the logically inevitable Absolute upon which the contingent depends, then one simply has misunderstood what the content of the concept of God truly is, and has nothing to contribute to the debate. It is unlikely, however, that such a person really cares to know what the true content of the concept is, or on what rational and experiential bases the concept rests. In my experience, those who make the most theatrical display of demanding ‘proof’ of God are also those least willing to undertake the specific kinds of mental and spiritual discipline that all the great religious traditions say are required to find God. If one is left unsatisfied by the logical arguments for belief in God, and instead insists upon some ‘experimental’ or ‘empirical’ demonstration, then one ought to be willing to attempt the sort of investigations necessary to achieve any sort of real certainty regarding a reality that is nothing less than the infinite coincidence of absolute being, consciousness, and bliss. In short, one must pray: not fitfully, not simply in the manner of a suppliant seeking aid or of a penitent seeking absolution bur also according to the disciplines of infused contemplation with real constancy of will and a patient openness to grace, suffering states of both dereliction and ecstasy with the equanimity of faith, hoping but not presuming, so as to find whether the spiritual journey, when followed in earnest, can disclose its own truthfulness and conduct one into communion with a dimension of reality beyond the ontological indigence of the physical. No one is obliged to make such an effort; but, unless one does, any demands one might make for evidence of the reality of God can safely be dismissed as disingenuous, and any arguments against belief in God that one might have the temerity to make to others can safely be ignored as vacuous.” ― David Bentley Hart, The Experience of God : Being, Consciousness, Bliss"

The word is the true, dependable reality: the solid ground on which we can stand, which holds firm even when the sun goes dark and the firmament disintegrates.

"“Faith is strength, courage, belief, will, hope, power, and determination all wrapped up together. Faith is the blade used to slay our doubts and fears.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“There are many things in this world that we do not know, that we cannot see, that we do not perceive or comprehend. But I have faith in a god who sees and perceives all, who knows and comprehends all. It is God upon whom I rely.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“Faith is not to be reserved for only difficult times. Faith is not confirmed solely in blessed times. Faith is not a rationed, desperate means to be used when hopelessness, fear, or frustration set in. Faith is power for each moment of each day. It is meant for all situations, from the mundane to the most critical. Faith is constant trust in every evidence you experience indicating that God is there.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“If the faith of a mustard seed can move mountains, imagine what the faith of a coconut seed could do!” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“I would not have complete confidence in God if He had not come through for me, time and again. My faith has taken years to grow and develop through the proffering of long, desperate prayers and the endurance of hard, exhausting trials. My faith is not based purely on hope for God’s existence but on evidences that He lives and is fully aware of me. Faith has taught me in whom to trust. Faith has shown me to whom I should turn when in need of anything.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“Faith is knowing you are not alone. It is realizing that God is right at your side. It is understanding that no matter what happens in life, He will be there to help you through it.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“When you have real faith, you act on it. Otherwise, you gain nothing. It’s like when you have an ice cream cone, you eat it. Otherwise, well… it melts.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“From the source of all infinite, a woven truth will come to stifle it. A dawn will rise when breath does flee and all of this will cease to be.From star specks to great seas, so too will they bow at the knees. Hold to it now, believe in what you are, overthrow them with tactics even if sitting afar. Use your power, fill up your cup, mourn no more nor cower in fear...soon, just wait its coming, do you hear?” ― Sai Marie Johnson"
"“BOOK EXCERPTDid Jesus actually die on the cross? The Roman soldiers were responsible for ensuring that all three crucified prisoners were dead. That was their job. The Roman army had brutal discipline for soldiers who didn't do their job correctly. For example, falling asleep on guard duty was punishable by death. Other corporal punishments included being beaten or having their clothes set on fire. The soldiers would have broken his legs if there was any possibility that Jesus was alive. They didn't. There wasn't anyone there who cried out, ""He's still alive!"" The Jewish rabbis in attendance wanted him to die. They would have said something if Jesus was still alive. After all, they wanted to guarantee that he died. I don't know how anyone could have survived being beaten, scourged, had a crown of thorns forced onto one's head, crucified, and then stabbed in either the lungs or the heart with a spear. The scourging alone would have been deadly. Jesus' dead body remained on the cross for a short while. Still, it would have been long enough for blood to accumulate in his lower extremities and for his body to cool. His lower extremities also would have turned bluish. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus retrieved the body and would have noticed at once if Jesus weren't dead. His body would have been warm, and his extremities would not have been distended and bluish. Joseph and Nicodemus didn't notice that, though, because they would have stopped preparing his body for burial if they did.” ― Tim Mack, Ph.D."
"“If she doesn’t believe me, then the easiest thing is to go along with her.” ― Holly Black, The Cruel Prince"
"“If I cannot be better than them, I will become so much worse.” ― Holly Black, The Cruel Prince"
"“These are the costs Muslims must calculate when considering the gospel: losing the relationships they have built in this life, potentially losing this life itself, and if they are wrong, losing their afterlife in paradise. It is no understatement to say that Muslims often risk everything to embrace the cross. But then again, it is the cross. There is a reason Jesus said, ""Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.” ― Nabeel Qureshi, Searching for Allah and Finding Jesus"
"“Fasting is, at its core, an invitation to intimacy. It's an emptying of all so we can be filled by His all.” ― Reward Sibanda, How to Fast: Rediscover the Ancient Practice for Unlocking Physical, Emotional, and Spiritual Renewal"
"“The key is faith + fate + feat” ― Palak Tewary"
"“This water was in your way to heaven, and written in your Lord's book; ye behoved to cross it: and therefore, kiss His wise and unerring providence. Let not the censures of men, who see but the outside of things (and scarce well that), abate your courage and rejoicing in the Lord; howbeit, your faith seeth the black side of providence, yet it hath a better side, and God shall let you see it.” ― Samuel Rutherford, The Loveliness of Christ"
"“Though all faith had left her during the war, she half staggered into St. Andrew's Church. She wanted to feel the touch of prayers fanning around her like butterfly wings, and she wanted to be held safe in the still coolness of the familiar building” ― Jacqueline Winspear, A Dangerous Place"
"“We may wish and beg life to “let this cup pass from me” but, eventually, it will come to the point where we have to drink from it if we want to save our sanity and so all we can do is TRUST, take a sip, and know that we will ultimately find our realness at the bottom of the cup.” ― Oli Anderson, Trust: A Manual for Becoming the Void, Building Flow, and Finding Peace"
"“The same God that placed that star in a precise orbit millennia before it appeared over Bethlehem in celebration of the birth of the Babe has given at least equal attention to placement of each of us in precise human orbits so that we may, if we will, illuminate the landscape of our individual lives, so that our light may not only lead others but warm them as well.” ― Neal A. Maxwell, That my family should partake"
"“Pick a drop of blood from your finger, pick a drop from another, smudge it all on the palm of your hand - now tell me, which is which - which is heretic, which is believer - which is the Christian blood, which is the Muslim - which is the faithful blood, which is forbidden!” ― Abhijit Naskar, Neurosonnets: The Naskar Art of Neuroscience"
"“Allah’s tests are not punishments but invitations... an invitation to grow, to trust, and to return to Him with a heart refined by struggle.” ― Alex Shaikh"
"“There may be times when we must make a courageous decision to hope even when everything around us contradicts this hope. Like Father Abraham, we will 'against hope believe in hope' (Romans 4:18). Or, as one writer expressed, 'in the depth of winter, we find within us an invincible summer.” ― Dieter F. Uchtdorf"
"“The same Bible verse may say something entirely different to you from what it does to me, based on our individual contexts. In other words, scripture is not monolithic. When we approach it prayerfully, it is personal.” ― Amos Smith, Holistic Mysticism: The Integrated Spiritual Path of the Quakers"
"“Gvardiol: “The only thing that matters is power. And you must do all you can whether it be lying or killing to achieve it.”Pep: “You’re wrong! What truly matters is truth. In our actions and in our words. I’ve always known it deep down. That’s why, I seek out the Terrans and their faith. My faith.” ― Michael P. Marpaung, Inquisitor's Promise"
"“I cling to hopeEven when it shakes me off” ― Nathaniel Luscombe, When One World Ends, Another Begins"
"“You may think God will protect you out there, but when you jump off a cliff, God doesn't catch you. His divine protection ends when people insist on doing stupid things they know better than to do!” ― R. Lee Smith, The Last Hour of Gann"
"“You have to listen to the still small voice of the Spirit daily if you want to know God.” ― Vince Baker"
"“God can be found in His Word, so when you get His Word in you, He will be found in you!” ― Vince Baker"
"“In the English Church a man succeeds, not through his capacity for belief but through his capacity for disbelief. Ours is the only Church where the sceptic stands at the altar, and where St. Thomas is regarded as the ideal apostle. Many a worthy clergyman, who passes his life in admirable works of kindly charity, lives and dies unnoticed and unknown; but it is sufficient for some shallow uneducated passman out of either University to get up in his pulpit and express his doubts about Noah’s ark, or Balaam’s ass, or Jonah and the whale, for half of London to flock to hear him, and to sit open-mouthed in rapt admiration at his superb intellect. The growth of common sense in the English Church is a thing very much to be regretted. It is really a degrading concession to a low form of realism. It is silly, too. It springs from an entire ignorance of psychology. Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the improbable.” ― Oscar Wilde, The Decay of Lying"
"“SELF-BETRAYAL is a sentimental melodrama; a deification of our own better judgment, an adoration of shame. I am always true to myself, that is the problem. Who else could I be true to?When I say that I have let myself down, I am boasting. I am the only person I cannot avoid being faithful to. My sexual relationship with myself, in other words, is a study in monogamy.” ― Adam Phillips, Monogamy"

"“To be respected is not my concern. So long as I seek to live in obedience to my Lord, respect will come accordingly from the people He deems it necessary.” ― Criss Jami, Healology"
"“This is a matter of definition, in the final analysis – and therefore, of faith. [The divine] is real insofar as its pursuit makes pain bearable, keeps anxiety at bay; and inspires the hope that springs eternal in the human breast. It is real insofar as it establishes the benevolent and intelligible cosmic order, that infinite place of sinful toil or faithful play. It is as real as the force that opposes pride and calls those who sacrifice improperly to their knees. It is as real as the further reaches of the human imagination, striving fully upward.” ― Jordan B. Peterson, We Who Wrestle with God: Perceptions of the Divine"
"“Did you write those books because you truly believed in the message?” I inquire. “Or because that particular topic happens to be a popular one and you merely just wanted to sell books?"" ""I don't understand the question! But I will say... people loved my catchphrase: Strength with a Smile!"" Alicia flashes a cheesy grin and twirls her long brown hair.” ― Sunshine Rodgers, The Roland Sisters and The Spirit Program"
"“We are all in the gutter more than we imagine, but we are also looking up at the Star.” ― Bear Grylls, Soul Fuel: Daily Devotions to Survive the Adventure of Life"
"“Faith is a requisite to living a sanctified life.” ― Chidiebere Orji Agbugba"

"“God loves you. He has not abandoned you. Pray, repent, study the scriptures, keep the commandments, and have faith that answers will come in God’s timing. They will. He loves you.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“I do not know all things. I might not believe some things. But I know what my mom believes; I have heard her testimony. I know her faith, and that has fed my faith on many grim occasions. Sometimes we do well to lean on the faith of others to pull us through until our own faith increases enough to sustain us.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“B’ comes before ‘S”; 2 before 19; the horse comes before the cart; and believing before seeing - This is the protocol of faith!” ― Gabriel Ladokun, Faith Journal | My Personal Journey of Faith"
"“The ‘truth’ that we tell ourselves will always be inferior to a ‘Truth’ that will always be greater than ourselves.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“The hardest part is walking toward the things that will seemingly result in our death. It isn’t the struggle, it isn’t the battle, and it isn’t the making. It is the moment when we clearly see all the ways we could be crushed by continuing and still take a step forward. In the pursuit of art, we learn the courage to face death, failure, and fear. It is the bravery of walking towards the things that feel impossible. It is the knowing that to practice our art is to practice resurrection again and again and again. Amen.” ― Alabaster Co., All That Is Made: A Guide to Faith and the Creative Life"
"“If God says 'This is the way you should live your life' then this is the way we should live our lives. The only road that leads to lasting joy and genuine happiness is the road that God has paved. It is a straight and narrow path. Have faith enough to stay the course.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“Have faithin God alone.Don’t doubt, fear, or falter,but bend to His will and power.Trust Him.” ― Richelle E. Goodrich, Hope Evermore: Quotes, Verse, & Spiritual Inspiration for Every Day of the Year"
"“Your belief means nothing unless you are faithful to it, all the way through, to the very end; when its revelation becomes your truth.” ― Hugh Mahn"
"“It is the nature of reactionary movements to claim that their power is negligible until it is absolute. It is the nature of right-wing American Christianity to nurture a martyrdom that was never theirs, and never will be theirs, and use its sentiments to feed their animus.” ― Talia Lavin, Wild Faith: How the Christian Right Is Taking Over America"
"“True love is a choice, even when it doesn’t come easily. It’s not selfish. It’s about giving to the one I love, even when I don’t feel like it.” ― Alena Mentink, A Choice of Love"

"“The realms of the soul and the spirit are so spacious and unending that this little bit of physical discomfort and suffering really doesn’t matter all that much. I do not feel I have been robbed of my freedom; essentially no one can do me any harm at all.” ― Etty Hillesum"
"“Living and dying, sorrow and joy, the blisters on my feet and the jasmine behind the house, the persecution, the unspeakable horrors — it is all as one in me, and I accept it all as one mighty whole and begin to grasp it better if only for myself; without being able to explain to anyone else how it all hangs together. I wish I could live for a long time so that one day I may know how to explain it, and if I am not granted that wish, well, then somebody else will perhaps do it, carry on from where my life has been cut short. And that is why I must try to live a good and faithful life to my last breath: so that those who come after me do not have to start all over again, need not face the same difficulties. Isn’t that doing something for future generations?” (3 July 1943)” ― Etty Hillesum"
"“It's a constant in this country that the people who make the laws love to talk about God when they take things from you.” ― Talia Lavin, Wild Faith: How the Christian Right Is Taking Over America"
"“Between us, we had over seventy years of marriage under our belts when we met each other in 2021. One would assume we would know everything there was to know about commitment, communication, and the covenant of a marriage relationship. Yet in all those years with our first spouses, we’d never experienced the intimacy and power of praying together. We’d never held hands to pray out loud for our marriage or each other. We weren’t even sure why or how to do that for ourselves until the darkness of our respective grief drove us down to our knees.” ― Mary T Portzen, Soul Mates: Path to a Praying Partnership"
"“It isn’t that rote prayers don’t have a place as a meditative form of prayer. After all, Jesus taught His disciples to pray the Our Father. But rote prayers alone are limiting. If the only conversations I have with a friend or spouse are reading or speaking from a memorized script, how close would I get to them? How well would we know each other without genuine conversation? I could be using all the right words, but would I be having heartfelt talks that encourage and strengthen intimacy? God desires that same intimacy, the kind we seek with a spouse or close friend.” ― Mary Portzen, Soul Mates: Path to a Praying Partnership"
"“We concluded the only way to decide what pleased our Father was to measure everything according to His Word, meditating on “whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable” (Philippians 4:8).We came up with a plan to make our choices based on the single question: Would we watch this, read that, go there, do this, or have this conversation if Jesus was sitting right next to us? The answer is simple.Because He is.” ― Mary Portzen, Soul Mates: Path to a Praying Partnership"
"“I often remind Nick these last fifteen years of our lives are the most important ones because we are following Jesus and walking the path to heaven together. I’d like to think we’ll have more than fifteen years together, but Nick is in his early seventies, and I just qualified for Medicare. We can’t count on it. What we do count on is God will give us enough time to fulfill His purpose for our lives.” ― Mary Portzen, Soul Mates: Path to a Praying Partnership"
"“Is the nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, and at the great moments of their life, the moment of their deepest, most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of their heart?” ― Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Grand Inquisitor"
"“Thou didst not come down from the cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking and reviling Thee, ""Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art He."" Thou didst not come down, for again Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle. Thou didst crave faith given freely, not based on a miracle. Thou didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him for ever.” ― Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Grand Inquisitor"
"“Faith exalts the human heart, by removing it from the market-place, making it sacred and unexchangeable. Under the jurisdiction of religion our deeper feelings are sacralised, so as to become raw material for the ethical life: the life lived in judgement. When faith declines, however, the sacred is unprotected from marauders; the heart can be captured and put on sale. When this happens the human heart becomes kitsch. The clichéd kiss, the doe-eyed smile, the Christmas-card sentiments advertise what cannot be advertised without ceasing to be. They therefore commit the salesman to nothing; they can be bought and sold without emotional hardship, since the emotion, being a fantasy product, no longer exists in its committed and judgement-bearing form.” ― Roger Scruton, An Intelligent Person's Guide to Modern Culture"
"“Human nature tends to disbelieve strange phenomena that doesn’t align with constraints of conventional reality. Dismissing experiences as imagination or insanity is less complicated than understanding their spiritual implications.” ― Elise Monet, Faith in the Inferno: The Development of a Baby Boomer's Spiritual Consciousness"
"“Nathan bowed his head, imagining God looking down past the stars and the cloud-skirted moon to Nathan behind the curtains and the widow on the sofa while both prayed for help.” ― KyLee Woodley, The Bounty Hunter's Surrender"
"“Life is entirely for us to share, love is completely what we receive. The truth that we discover is not limited to our belief; but exclusive to our faith.” ― Hugh Mahn"
"“I have got the blessed eye of faith” ― Bahadur Shah Zafar, Intikhab-e-Kalaam: Bahadur Shah Zafar / انتخاب کلام : بہادر شاہ ظفر"
"“She wore hers sacars as the best attire.A stunning dress made of hellfire” ― T.L. Martin"
"“Faith is the rock in the storm that ignores the ferocity of the tempest not out of ignorance, but out of a confidence that the lesser person cannot help but interpret as ignorance.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“She would just have to give Him time to see what He would do. Sometimes His answers came at the last moment with no prior warning--not exactly a comforting thought. But His answers were never too late and would come at just the right time.” ― Alena Mentink, A Choice of Love"
"“Then it is, perhaps, that He must allow our whole world to be turned upside down in order to remind us it is not our permanent abode or final destiny, to bring us to our senses and restore our sense of values, to turn our thoughts once more to him--even if at first our thoughts are questioning and full of reproaches.” ― Walter Ciszek, SJ"
"“God is constant in his love if we will but look to him, he will sustain us in every storm if we will but cry to him, he will save us if we will but reach out our hand to him. He is there, if we will only turn to him and learn to trust in him alone.” ― Walter Ciszek, SJ"
"“To mollycoddle malice is not religion, to pamper prejudice is not piety.” ― Abhijit Naskar, Azad Earth Army: When The World Cries Blood"
"“Because all the things God isn't for me,"" she said, ""you are. Because of you I see Him every day. So start talking lizardman, but I warn you, you've got a hard talk ahead of you if you're going to convince me there's no God after He gave you to me.” ― R. Lee Smith, The Last Hour of Gann"
"“To pray is to set in motion a force that will crush your skepticism about prayers ability to crush your skepticism.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"

"“The Evangelical is not afraid of facts, for he knows that all facts are God’s facts; nor is he afraid of thinking, for he knows that all truth is God’s truth, and right reason cannot endanger sound faith. He is called to love God with all his mind’ and part of what this means is that, when confronted by those who, on professedly rational grounds, take exception to historic Christianity, he must set himself not merely to deplore or denounce them but to out-think them. It is not his business to argue men into faith, for that cannot be done; but it is his business to demonstrate the intellectual adequacy of the biblical faith and the comparative inadequacy of its rivals, and to show the invalidity of the criticisms that are brought against it. This he seeks to do, not from any motive of intellectual self-justification, but for the glory of God and of His gospel. A confident intellectualism expressive of robust faith in God, whose Word is truth, is part of the historic evangelical tradition.” ― J. J. Packer"

"“By our adoration, we can love Jesus today, like the humble shepherds of Bethlehem, like the magi who brought their gifts, or like Mary of Bethany who poured very pure nard over the head of the Christ.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“Thus those who remain before the Lord fulfill a great service; they present to Christ all those who do not know him or who are far from him; in their name they keep vigil before him.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“Faith is the pure act of the spirit, freed from the senses. For here (before the Blessed Sacrament), the senses are of no use; they have no part to play. It is the only mystery of Jesus Christ where the senses must be absolutely still.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“Kneeling before the Eyucharist is truly a profession of freedom. In the end, it is the most worthwhile and radical remedy against the idolatries of yesterday and of today.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“Some ask why the Church does not want to bless a new union between two people who are seeking to rebuild their lives after the failure of their marriages. One might ask oneself why priests do not show more compassion or mercy, since Jesus forgave all sins and since the priest is there to give divine mercy freely. These biblical texts show that Jesus speaks of marriage in another register. Christ united himself to humanity in an indissoluble way in an eternal marriage by dying on the Cross. Sacramental marriage is sealed in the absolutely indissoluable covenant of Christ with his Church.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“To want to meet God in us in a ""heart-to-heart"" without passing through the ""face to face"" of adoration requires a purification of the inner self and a solid formation without which prayer risks leading us back to ourselves and not to God present in us.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“Praying is not asking God to bless our own intentions, however good they may be. Praying is asking God for a new way of looking at the world, at others, and at oneself, as well as the grace to live in conformity to the divine will.” ― Florian Racine, Could You Not Watch with Me One Hour?: How to Cultivate a Deeper Relationship with the Lord through Eucharistic Adoration"
"“We distance ourselves too much from the Holy Eucharist, we do not preach often enough about this mystery of love par excellence; so souls suffer, they become entirely sensual and material in their piety, inordinately attaching themselves to creatures, because they do not know how to find their consolation and strength in our Lord.” ― St. Peter Julian Eymard"
"“Keep the fasts, my dear; that's supremely important! Wednesdays and Fridays, well, God will overlook that; but Lent itself, God forbid!” ― Ivan Goncharov, The Same Old Story"
"“I, an unstable and uncertain man, had been steered into leadership in an institution that laid claim to transcendental levels of stability and certainty.

"“The tools of reason are cold and inert; they cannot be used to form the foundations of those values from which we become animate. So when contemporary philosophers, scientists, politicians, and even the common man attempt to justify their beliefs based on reason alone, they are ultimately doomed to fail in their efforts. Science and logic are powerful tools of excavation to uncover facts, but at the depths of the canyon from which they dig, the question of why will always echo back to them.” ― Tanner Cook"
"“Do not feel compelled to justify your faith through reason and logic; these are only instruments used to rationalize your passions. But these tools are cold and lifeless.

Am I better off, now that I know this celestial arch isn’t divinely inspired – that there isn’t some meaningful purpose to it? Is that truly the answer I wanted when I asked myself where this spectacle came from? Do I stare up at the night sky because I search for the elements that comprise the star? Do we rationalize the tears that are shed at the birth of a child and the death of a loved-one? Do we ask ourselves why we dance? Do we contemplate that question before we allow the music to stir us? Do we allow it at all, or does it allow us? Not a single note, by itself, compels a couple to gracefully embrace, yet, this is how they would have us understand it - music, merely a series of connected notes and nothing more.” ― Tanner Cook, Liberty and the Will to Power: A Manifesto for the Amoral Libertarian"

One truly wonders how the corrupt dare to challenge the pure, and how failure dares to disparage success! What is strange is that we Muslims accept this labeling of the most successful and beautiful marriage as a shubha! We add it to the group of shubha(s) and start the case for defense. We should have asked from the beginning, ""What specifically is the problem, so that we can respond to it?"" Why do you –objectors– assume that we accept your standards?!It is strange that we allow Islam haters who defeat us militarily in every despicable way to also defeat us psychologically by occupying our minds and souls. So here we are: Judging our religion, our history, and our Prophet's (ﷺ) tradition according to our opponents' standards! Accepting the classification of a part of religion as a shubha means losing half the battle.

"“God belongs equally to believers and atheists, but believers “authorized” the right to the word God and its meaning. Agnostics and atheists got caught on it, although they would like to know the truth, too. Since God is the truth, atheists did not realize this yet. Once they realize it, they will become believers because they believe in truth and God is Truth. However, this does not mean that the Christian God or the God of Islam is the truth, but that the truth itself is God. The majority of believers, atheists, and agnostics would instead like to know or accept the truth rather than a stolen idea of God and lies (although many of them conceived with good intentions) presented as truth.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“If we accept that intelligent design is not necessarily what we think it is, or if we enrich the word (term) design to contain additional meaning in extraordinary contexts or ideas about God and creation, we may understand that design may be the design without designing, that the creation may be creation without creating in the way we see it and understand it. We admit that there can be no design without designing and no creation without creating, but what is to be created or designed in the absolute? If the Absolute is the “highest” form of “existence,” then it must be, at the same time, absolute perfection. If there is absolute perfection, what creation can match the existing perfection? We must agree that no possible outcome of the Absolute can be more perfect than the Absolute itself. Absolute itself is perfection; otherwise, it would not be absolute.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“If the creation of the world needed to be perfect (absolutely perfect), then why create (design) to arrive at the same point of the Absolute, which would be pure idleness, an idle walk from one perfection to another or from nothing to another nothing? If the purpose of creating is not only in creating but more in existing, and not only in existing per se but in meaningful and purposeful existing, then this creating or creation must first and foremost accommodate its purpose rather than perfection itself. Its perfection must be valued and measured by and through its purpose and meaning rather than by pure perfection. Measure through purpose makes us see the deeper importance and meaning in the lack of ordinary perfection. Perfection and absolute goodness (benevolence) are not necessarily as we see them and would like to see them. When we measure ideals through purpose, the idea, function, and manifestation of perfection and purpose become more pronounced, although subtly.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“To be perfect in the absolute mode, in the same manner, as in the modes manifested through plurality, is impossible. We are not talking about degrees of perfection but about potential, possibilities, and, ultimately, the sine qua non of existence in the light of only one possible imperative—the imperative of existence and life.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“If absolute perfection is an idle walk from one point to another, which is no walk at all, then there is no existence and no life. If we come from this postulate and premise, the existence and life, as we see it, must be, conditionally speaking, “less perfect.” This less-perfect world (existence) is possible only through creation or recreation (“design”). But this creation is not possible without recreation. There is nothing to start from except the Absolute itself—Being and Nonbeing (Something and Nothing). There is nothing to hope for outside this realm. Nothing can be created from nothing if the Being does not create it. Regardless of how omnipotent it is, the Being cannot create anything except out of itself. Even creation out of itself would not be the real creation but recreation because the created being would still be the same (although modified).” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Now we come to the idea of ex nihilo. We do not know anything about the world before the Big Bang, which could mean that the world came from nothing. But if we ask religious people, nothing can be created out of nothing. But if nothing comes out of nothing, the creation must be the “Child” of existing something, which must be God. If even God cannot create something out of nothing, it must create the world (universe) out of itself. If this creation is the creation out of itself, then it cannot inherently be different from the so-called “creator.” If it cannot be inherently different from the creator, then this creation cannot be precisely called creation but recreation. But even this recreation is impossible without the Nothing. In this sense, there is a creation (partially) out of nothing (ex nihilo) because the real creating force is the Absolute and not only a God or a Universal Mind. The Universal Mind creates and procreates with the help of Nothingness and not solely from nothingness because ex nihilo nihil fit—from nothing, nothing comes to be.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“If God is perfect, from a religious point of view, why would creation be needed? Why create a world which is inherently less perfect than the creator itself? Why not create Paradise immediately and avoid original sin and eternal torment in Hell? Paradise is a more peaceful and ideal place. Why challenge and tempt a human being so much? Why provoke a potential rebellion by the “Devil?” Is it the boredom of God? Is it creating solely for creating? Or is it the creation in the pursuit of purpose and meaning? What higher purpose and meaning is there if not perfection itself? Following our already elaborated ideas, we should not view this purpose from the point of perfection. Still, the point of existence and life, for even a perfect God, is dead and nonexistent at absolute perfection. Absolute perfection obliterates existence.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Perfection” of existence is in its plurality and its “imperfection.” Existence contains the whole purpose in a constant, eternal pursuit of perfection. In this pursuit, the mode, motives, and, above all, meaning are found. Even if there were a possibility for perfect particularities within the realm of existence (world, universe), this perfection would still undermine the higher perfection achieved through evolution. The perfection of particularities would undermine the absolute potential of the Absolute for infinity. The world must be “perfect” (or “imperfect”) not only concerning the Absolute and not only concerning the particular realities but also proportionately perfect (or imperfect) concerning its potential and the potential of the Absolute concerning eternity and infinity.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“The Absolute can exercise its potential only through non-accidental accidents or chances. Chance, although almost accidental, is not accidental. In a predetermined world, chances would not be possible. Even if chances existed, they would only be appearances of chances and not real chances. In a world (universe) established based on its full potential, chance is compatible with determinism. This almost absurd statement becomes logical if observed from the point of view of the potential of the Absolute, which is predetermined. Absolute is not only absolute but also capable of infinity by exercising its infinite potential.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Although the absolute potential of the Absolute and its existence are predetermined, any particular existence is developed, among other things, through chance. The voyage toward infinity allows free will and secures its compatibility with determinism based on the absolute potential of the Absolute itself. The absolute potential would not be possible without the magic force of chance. If a world were predetermined, that would be like playing out the story with the known outcome. In such a world, even if existence, or multiple creations, would go ad infinitum, the outcome of any possible existence (universe) would be predetermined and therefore known at the moment of creation. If this were possible, even theoretically, what would be the purpose of such existence (existences) if the outcome is already known? If the sole purpose were to exist, this possibility would not satisfy the ultimate purpose, which is the meaning itself.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“The only real purpose and the only real meaning lies in freedom, and there is no real freedom without free will. Free will can only exist if there is an element of chance. But this chance is not a chance as we ordinarily view it, but a chance for possibility and existence, a chance of existence itself. In this manner, the fundamental forces of the world are manifested in the world, regardless of the level of awareness of this knowledge. Knowledge of the world is intrinsic to the world, irrespective of its level or degree of awareness. On the other hand, Chance is the real potential of the world.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Only emptiness and nothingness can provide space to the world; chance is the uniting force of the Being and the Nonbeing. If we view evolution in this context, evolution, as selection, is no longer a random selection or Herbert Spencer’s “survival of the fittest” but the survival of existence itself. Whatever survives is thanks not only through combinations and recombination of some otherwise self-organized dead matter, self-powered peculiarly through an infinite series of accidents, but rather through an infinite series of predetermined chances. Determinism is based more on chance than on determination. A determined chance is not a chance, strictly speaking. This chance is not chaotic and random. The chance is more orderly than a lack of chance. The chance gives rise to a more deterministic world regarding purpose, meaning, and destiny. Destiny is the purpose of determination. But destiny, as all else discussed, is not necessarily determined. What is determined is that there should be existence, purpose, and meaning. From the point of view of purpose and meaning, the best possible existence is the existence responsible for its own becoming through chance.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“The bigger question than determinism and free will or destiny is whether the chance is predetermined. As one of the fundamental forces of the Universe and its evolution (natural selection), the predetermined chance is not and cannot be proof against God’s existence but precisely the opposite; regardless of how paradoxical this may sound, it is proof of its existence.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“If chance is less accidental than we think and the world is less self-governed, the outcome is also the same for believers and non-believers. All arguments and counterarguments become worthless because of existence's vastness and paradoxical nature or the universe itself. Under such a scenario, all views or counterarguments would fit equally on either side.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“What is natural selection? Do organisms develop due to an environment, or does the environment only trigger the potential to evolve in almost endless ways? What determines the survival of the fittest? How are the fittest organisms or animals formed? How can the first fittest animal be formed, and based on what? How can anybody, or anything, become stronger or better than anybody else or anything else, from the same material, under the same conditions? (Is fitness already there?)” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Agnosticism is compatible with faith. We either believe or not, irrespective of our ability to find the truth. Faith, developed or established based on the nominal religion, is not proof of our ability to prove God’s existence and is not proof of our implied agnosticism. Genuine faith is based on the belief in God regardless of the lack of evidence, religion, or agnosticism that may exist in a believer.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“A believer is not necessarily someone who never had any doubts about the existence of God but rather someone who did not submit to skepticism and doubt. A believer is the one who fights agnosticism; an agnostic is the one who submits to it. To put it differently—a believer is the one whose atheism (or agnosticism) submits to his or her faith (or belief); an atheist is the one whose faith (if there is any) submits to atheism rather than submitting to faith or agnosticism; an agnostic is the one in whom faith and disbelief are equally present. This equidistance to God and atheism makes agnostics appear somewhat indifferent about these questions. Agnostics would rather wait for proof than bother tirelessly with the question without evidence. In believers, faith wins; in atheists, disbelief wins; in agnostics, neither belief nor disbelief wins.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“An agnostic does not want to succumb to a religious heritage without proof supported by science. An agnostic is guided more by rational thinking than by emotions and religious sentiments that may or may not exist in him or her. This fight, or dilemma, in every one of us, is a fight between a believer and an atheist. Many believers are, perhaps, agnostics to some extent. They know they don’t know the truth and will never find it, but they still believe (credo quia absurdum). Faith and agnosticism do not necessarily exclude each other, as it is usually perceived, and are compatible.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Confusion is caused by some, or many, agnostics refusing to believe or disbelieve God’s existence rather because of their interpretation of agnosticism or God than because they are inherently suspicious. If proved, one way or the other, they would accept either way. They seek evidence for God’s existence.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“A believer rejects the idea of disbelief merely because it is impossible to prove God’s existence or to know it in any other way except through faith. Although this may sound paradoxical, this approach is more rational than agnosticism because agnosticism excludes belief only because there is no evidence, even though providing that evidence is “impossible.” On the other hand, nobody can say, prove, or exclude the possibility of such proof.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“All major philosophers are “right” to a greater or lesser extent. It’s not merely a matter of right and wrong but of improving thought and discoveries that lead to a clearer understanding of the world. Every major philosopher provided a bit of understanding that clarified the crucial problems, even for those who objected to the ideas of the same philosophers.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“Opponents of the particular ideas of past philosophers may be equally indebted, to a larger or lesser extent, to the very same philosophers they oppose as those they agree with. One thing is sure—there is no complete agreement or disagreement, nor can there be one, with any of the philosophers. (Complete agreement can be expected only within purely religious thought based on the dogmas of nominal religions.)” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“The main problem lies not in the beliefs but in the conception of God. What is God? Depending on the answer to the question of what God is, our relation, not only to God but to the idea of beliefs and religions, is formed and resolved. The main obstacle to this problem comes from our concept of God and not from God or the world itself. First of all, we cannot agree on what God is. We only see, analyze, and interpret religions in their expressed forms, primarily based on revelations that serve (and must serve) as God’s given laws. In these books and “laws,” God is described, ascribed, and prescribed. As such, God is a defined and untouchable being. The status of untouchability lies in revelations by the prophets, which is to say, in “God’s own words.” That is the only legitimacy to base these laws and secure them. We have no other fact or proof except the words of the few, which we must believe and follow.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“What do we do by following these words or rules, laws, prophets and their revelations, and religions? We only believe in those who uttered and wrote these words and revelations. However, we do not know if there were any revelations in the first place or even if they were “real” to become the measures or expressions of truth or God automatically. There is nothing beyond this secret except our belief not in God but in the people (so-called prophets).” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“These practices persisted for thousands of years, and it is a logical consequence that our real idea about God, or our idea about “real God,” necessarily became so distorted that we cannot talk about this idea or concept with almost any certainty. In this manner, we can never know if we talk about the same thing and mean the same thing unless we speak to people with the same opinions and way of thinking (followers).” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"
"“There are ideas of many Gods (or many ideas of One God), and that’s why there are many religions in practice and hundreds of religions in the past. The question, in religions, is not what God is but who has the right to God (whose God is better).” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"

"“Just like there are dishes you can cook up in a jiffy and ones that take more time and care. I've prayed some pretty big prayers over the years that seemed to go unanswered. And if I wasn't careful, I could start to believe that God didn't love me because he didn't give me what I'd asked for. I had to learn that my faith shouldn't depend on whether or not God answers my prayers exactly the way I want Him to.” ― Lynn Austin, Waiting for Christmas"
"“In a world of choice, suffering is always a possibility. Wesuffer because of our own self-destructive choices. We suffer from the sins of others. And wesuffer because of Adam and Eve’s first sin.

And the Lord said, `If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this sycamine tree, ""Be uprooted and planted in the sea!"" and it would obey you.""' The point is surely that, since such a thing is plainly never going to happen, you can see how little faith any one will ever have. It is like the rhetorical question of Luke 18:8, ""When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?"" The same double bind has caught the father of the deaf-mute epileptic in Mark 9:24, ""1 believe; help my unbelief!""

It is like Plato’s allegory of the ave, in which reality can only be experienced as shadows on the cave wall.

Your negative life experiences are nothing compared to the positive adventures you will have in the future. The world has so much more to offer than you can imagine. Keep on trusting.

In that moment, I became a believer in God.” ― Jacqueline Tusi, Know Thyself: An Autobiographical Manual for Designing a Successful Life"
"“Thaddeus was just a normal guy, different from the angels roaming around. He was almost embarrassed to meet the grandeur of God, seeing himself as so small when he first got to Heaven on Orientation Day. Though he felt youthful and looked young, Thaddeus had died in his sleep at ninety years old, awakening in Heaven. He was anxious to be more than what he was on Earth and willing to prove himself now that he felt he’d been given a second chance with God.” ― Sunshine Rodgers, This Is My Heaven"

"“What ought to be imperfect in time is, because of its very imperfection there, perfect when viewed under the form of eternity. To live, to live just as we do, that—if we could only realize it—is the purpose and the crown of living. We must seek improvement; we must be dissatisfied with ourselves; that is the appointed attitude, the histrionic pose, that is to keep the ball rolling. But while we feel this dissatisfaction we are perfectly satisfactory, and while we play our game and constantly lose it, we are winning the game for God.” ― George Santayana, Three Philosophical Poets: Lucretius, Dante And Goethe"

"“Joy requires at least two conditions: submission and service. If yee abide, submission means staying put when it might seem smart to quit. It means having done all to stand when there is only a toehold. It means believing God when it appears far wiser to believe everybody else. It means defying one's feelings and fears and saying triumphantly, 'Thy will be done.'Joy comes through service. Most Christians are activists--they get caught up in some kind of church work. But not all of it is good. Not all of it is essential. Even missionaries find themselves tangled in lesser things than winning the lost. Unprayerful souls soon get diverted from the supreme task he appointed for them. This is why submission is also necessary. Let me summarize it this way: The way to enjoy indestructible peace and joy is to determine 1.) to do whatever God commands, however difficult. 2.) to endure whatever God appoints, however severe. 3.) to obtain whatever God promises, however seemingly unobtainable. 4.) to die daily, however costly the crucifixion. 5.) to love my enemies, however misunderstood in this. 6.) to pray without ceasing, and in everything give thanks. This will give one a healthy soul, and a conscience void of offense before God and man.” ― Leonard Ravenhill, Revival God's Way"

To know the meaning you had to go through the experience and even then the meaning changed before your eyes. ""Noble purpose"" was, after all, an untranslatable experience.

Never let anyone convince you that GOD is so small that HE cannot handle big questions or so frail that HE cannot carry you when you cannot stand on your own.

"“You must understand that all of us are in the same boat which, at times, can find itself in calm seas and at others in rough ones. Maybe you'll tell me that yours has only seen rough seas.

"“I think there was always a yearning in me for something else, something beyond myself, from which I felt excluded. Even in the most chaotic times, when I was struggling with addiction, I always felt desirous of those who had a religious dimension to their lives. I had a kind of spiritual envy, a longing for a belief in the face of the impossibility of belief that addressed a fundamental emptiness inside me. There was always a yearning.As I’ve gotten older, I have come to see that maybe the search is the religious experience - the desire to believe and the longing for meaning, the moving towards the ineffable. Maybe that is what is essentially important, despite the absurdity of it. Or, indeed, because of the absurdity of it. When it comes down to it, maybe faith is just a decision like any other. And perhaps God is the search itself.” ― Kurt Vile"
"“You're responsibility as a Christian is not to test GOD but to trust GOD.

And yet, standing in a forest forced silent by the bitter hand of winter I was reminded that spring is never deterred despite how bitter winter’s hand might be. For it is not the ‘hope’ of spring.

And now, dear God, I think, dear God in whom I do not believe, I pray you to stop this, for I am deathly frightened. Dear God, I smell my fear, with an oder as distinct as ozone on the air after a lightening flash. I feel fear so palpable it has a color, an oozing fiery red, and I feel it pitifully in my bones, which ache. My pain is so extreme that I can barely move down this hot avenue, and for a moment cannot, as my backbone bows with fear, as if a smelted rod, red-hot and livid, had been laid there. Dear God, dear God, I am in agony and fear, and whatever I may have done to make you bring this down upon me, release me, please, I pray, release me. Release me. Dear God in whom I do not believe, dear God, let me go free.” ― Scott Turow, Presumed Innocent"

"“Secular materialism dismisses belief in spiritual reality and the use of imagination as false; it sees beauty as dispensable and subjective, emotion as chemical, imagination (and with it, religion) as fantasy. Ironically, this view increasingly influences the way we live out our faith and speak about God, as apologists seek to argue God's existence on materialism's own terms, using scientific proof–style reasoning, and analytical debate to ""prove"" the reality of the spiritual world. It filters down to us in a thousand ordinary ways, shaping our models of spiritual growth, lines of productivity or casting faith as an assent to a list of doctrinal statements rather than the renewal of ourselves and stories. It makes us doubt the ""usefulness"" of beauty or the spiritual purpose of imagination, but this is a profoundly un-Christian view of faith and personhood. To reject image, emotion, and story as peripheral to faith is to ignore the way God created us – as being made in his image to create in our turn, as souls capable of both reason and analysis, but also equally capable of imagination, creativity, and emotion.” ― Sarah Clarkson"

On the other hand, there are those who will, within a year, perform acts of heroic faith and love which they would not now believe though a man should show them unto them.

I would say this to all people who are trying to become musicians or writers or artists of any kind: learn as much as you can about your craft, of course, but ultimately trust your own instinctive impulses. Have faith in yourself, so you can stand beside whatever it is you have done and fight for it, because if you can invest it with that faith, then it has its own truth, its own honesty, its own resilient vulnerability, and hence its own value.” ― Nick Cave"

"“At the same time, if there is infinity outside us is there not infinity within us? Are not these two infinities (a horrifying plural!) superimposed one upon the other, and is not the second infinity so to speak subjugated to the first, its mirror and its echo, an abyss that is concentric with another abyss? Is it not also intelligent? Does it not think, love and desire? If both infinities are intelligent, then each has in principle a Will, and there is an I in the higher infinity just as there is in the lower. That lower I is the soul, and the higher I is God. To establish in the mind a contact between the higher and the lower Infinities, this is to pray.” ― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables"

"“What we mean, in the last resort, by 'an answer to prayer', is that from the beginning of time, before he set about the building of the worlds, God foreknew every prayer that human lips would breathe, and took it into account. That, and nothing less, is the staggering claim which we make every time we say the 'Our Father'.If I could have collected all the symposiasts in a room, this is the issue I would have put to them, to 'try their spirits'. By all means (I would have said) let us leave dogma on one side, let us take no notice of all the secular disputes which divide the sympathies of Christian people, let us refrain as far as possible from prying into the mysterious secrets, too high for our ken. But- do you believe that God runs the world, and cares what happens in the world? For, if so, you will have to find something better than a pale, pantheist abstraction to satisfy your notion of God. And if not, you may spare your inkstands; nothing you can tell us about your religion will ever strengthen an infirm purpose or heal a broken heart.” ― Ronald Knox, Caliban in Grub Street 1930 [Leather Bound]"

"“I may be a bigot, I may be a pedant' but I believe I have the ordinary Englishman with me here. He does not want 'religion'; he wants God.And if you tell him that he knows God by an intuitive perception, you will only make him unhappy. He is fully conscious that the word came into his vocabulary when he was a child, when he was accustomed to accept from his elders a multitude of traditions, some of which his riper mind has discarded; that he has lived with the idea and grown accustomed to it, that it has formed part of a fairyland which he would like to find true. Precisely for that reason, he distrusts the sentiment; he suspects himself of fostering a grateful illusion, suspects that the wish was father to the thought. The notion of God fits in with his higher ideals, with his dearer hopes; all the more reason to surmise that it has been coined, by successive ages of mythology, for that purpose. The very reason why you ask him to believe in God, namely, that he wants to believe in God, is his main reason for doubting. The elders, when they heard Helen plead, made allowances for the beauty of her voice, lest they should be spellbound by its influence; what if this hope, too, should be an illusion of the Sirens?The Englishman wants truth of fact; you will not get him to replace it by artistic values. The pressure of fact is all around him, reflected in the daily urgency of living; you must give him a metaphysic of fact, for the alternative is despair.” ― Ronald Knox, Caliban in Grub Street 1930 [Leather Bound]"

"“His first destination, whenever he rose thus with ample time in hand, was always the altar of Saint Winifred, with its silver reliquary, where he stopped to exchange a little respectful and affectionate conversation with his countrywoman. He always spoke Welsh to her. The accents of his childhood and hers brought them into a welcome intimacy, in which he could ask her anything and never feel rebuffed. Even without his advocacy, he felt, her favor and protection would go with Hugh to Cambridge, but there was no harm in mentioning the need.” ― Ellis Peters (Edith Pargeter)"

"“How wonderful it is to know that we go through no experiences where God is not there in divine companionship, and the hotter the fire the sweeter the fellowship. You know, I can tell you, folks, in my own experience, that whenever I get into a situation where I decide to take a stand for something and it’s the unpopular thing to do, and you start getting flack, you have this tremendous sense of divine companionship. It’s what Peter talked about when he talked about the fact that when we go through persecution, the Spirit of grace and glory rests on us. I had this overwhelming sense of the presence of God strengthening. And here they were in the fiery furnace in divine companionship.- Uncompromising Faith in the Fiery Furnace, Part 2 (Sermon)” ― John F. MacArthur Jr."

"“Before I understand what I am doing, silent words pour out in a torrent of prayer. Oh, how long my spirit has been bound by bitterness.But now, a ray of mercy has pierced the hidden dungeon of my soul. My griefs drain away, and hope fills the void. Words of confession become whispers of praise. As my feet move through the streets of Utsanek, I exchange guilt for forgiveness, resentment for thanksgiving, turmoil for peace.” ― Andrea Renae, Where Darkness Dwells"
"“Beloved, let each individual stand resolute in their divine calling. Whatever path one is summoned to walk, let it be honored as a sacred undertaking, for it is not the nature of the work itself that determines its holiness but rather the intention and purpose behind it.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“Beloved, it is within the crucible of adversity that a man's true strength is forged, for it is through the fiery trials of life's struggles that one uncovers the depths of one's resilience.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“Beloved, it is when one transitions from the realm of passive observation to the active pursuit of divine connection that the forces of opposition are stirred, for in the very act of praising and worshiping the Almighty, the gates of chaos are flung open, unleashing the tempestuous winds of resistance.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“From the ashes of failure, sorrow, hardship, and loss, the most exquisite souls arise, their journey marked by empathy and humility. Those who have plumbed the depths of despair and emerged, transformed, possess an ineffable beauty of spirit that cannot be denied. They, tempered by adversity, radiate empathy, humility, and a profound reverence for life, serving as beacons of inspiration to all who behold them. Remember, dear ones, the most exquisite spirits are not born of idyllic circumstances but are forged in the crucible of life's trials.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“Beloved, it is in the triumph over adversity that life reveals its profound fascination, and in the transcendence of its obstacles that we discover its true worth.

"“Beloved, the faithful do not toil to attain celestial bliss; rather, they embark on a transformative journey to cultivate the very essence of heaven within themselves. Through this odyssey, the burdens of pride, conceit, selfishness, insecurity, hate, and worry are relinquished, as the virtues of humility, gratitude, love, and joy are embraced, thereby transfiguring the human experience into a reflection of the divine.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“As a 12th house stellium, the Law of Assumption has been my gold mine. I assume that something has already gone in my favor, detach from the idea, and then it shows up in my physical reality.

"“In the early stages of any schism, its promoters find themselves obliged to hold by outworn traditions, because they have no central authority which can initiate, and sanction, disciplinary developments. Hence they seldom fail to reproach the Catholic Church with a spirit of innovation. 'It is a common trait among the heretics and schismatics of all ages; schism and heresy have almost always, for their point of departure, a regret for the past, the claim or the dream of going back to the fountain-source of a religious idea, to the discipline or the faith of an apostolic age.” ― Ronald Knox, Enthusiasm: A Chapter in the History of Religion"
"“We need not doubt that the Evangelical movement had a powerful effect in waking up eighteenth-century England from its religious apathy, or that eighteenth-century England needed it. Where it failed was in its long-term effects. Religion became identified in the popular mind with a series of moods, in which the worshipper, disposed thereto by all the arts of the revivalist, relished the flavours of spiritual peace. You needed neither a theology nor a liturgy; you did not take the strain of intellectual inquiry, nor associate yourself whole-heartedly with any historic tradition of worship. You floated, safely enough, on the little raft of your own faith, eagerly throwing out the lifeline to such drowning neighbours as were ready to catch it; meanwhile the ship was foundering. It is this by-passing of an historic tradition in favour of a personal experience that has created the modem religious situation in England, and to some extent in the English-speaking world. The Oxford Movement did but lock the door on a stolen horse. On the one hand, it is assumed that every man's religion is his own affair; it does not concern, need not alarm his neighbours. On the other hand, the Christian witness has become a sectional affair; Christianity is one of the fads which people adopt if they are interested in that kind of thing. A poster in a railway station, bidding you be prepared to meet your God, is passed by with an indulgent smile. If people are burdened with a sense of sin, by all means let them seek comfort in some conventicle which promises them release from it; the same is perhaps true of people who begin to feel lonely in old age. But always religion is thought of, instinctively, as a way of changing from one state of mind into another.” ― Ronald Knox"
"“Our aspirations are too often tainted by our greed, tarnished by the foolishness of our trifling agendas, leveraged by the rot of our biases, infected by adherence to the toxicity of politically-correct propaganda, and misappropriated by our desire for acclaim and acceptance. And the subsequent rot that gorges itself on such aberrant behaviors is veneered thick with lies that incessantly deny that any such rot exists or that it is being liberally fed. Prayer is the single force that has both the potency and capacity to transform our greed into grace, make sacrifice our agenda, bring bias to heel at the feet of a passion to bless, transform the corrosive constraints of politics into an unquenchable thirst to serve, and rest in the fact that if God accepts us no other acceptance is necessary. Prayer is the game-changer. The culture-changer. The life-changer. Make no mistake about it. It is the answer to the desperation of our times and the hope of a future.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“And the fact that we took that leap, without knowing that everything would work out?

"“Often, it's the small things in life that bring the greatest joy.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."

"“Beloved, it is in the crucible of life's challenges that the true splendor of existence is unveiled, for it is through the act of conquering seemingly insurmountable obstacles that one imbues their journey with meaning, transforming mere existence into a profound and worthwhile odyssey.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“Beloved, it is in the sanctity of our spiritual and religious communities that we find the ultimate refuge from the forces of darkness that pervade our world. As long as we persist in a state of egocentrism, materialism, and spiritual cynicism, our capacity to effect positive change shall remain woefully compromised, for it is only through a transcendent and magnanimous relationship with the divine that we may access the wellspring of virtue necessary to transform the world around us.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“Beloved, our tolerance, prohibitions, and enforcements are the silent instructors through which we impart the profound lessons of respect. They are the unseen pedagogues that shape the boundaries of reverence, molding the sacred space in which honor resides. In the permissive expanse of what we allow, we etch the contours of esteem's terrain. Each indulgence scripts the depths to which regard may traverse. Conversely, in the fertile void of our prohibitions, we plant the seeds of deference. What we forbid inscribes the hallowed ground where veneration takes root and flourishes. Yet we chisel the definitive form of respect through the decisive hand of enforcement. Each exercised injunction is a chisel's strike, gradually giving rise to respect's exquisite visage. Thus, the triadic praxis of tolerance, prohibition, and enforcement weaves the intricate tapestry upon which the symphony of regard eternally echoes. Through this debate, we endlessly sculpt the sacred ethos of honor to which we all inescapably bow.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."
"“Beloved, it is at the threshold of our most astounding triumphs that we invariably find ourselves confronted by the most formidable of adversaries, for the cosmos invariably demands that we demonstrate our worthiness for the glories that await us by surmounting the most daunting of challenges.” ― Bishop W.F.

"“La speranza senza la fede non definisce i credenti, ma gli ottimisti. L'ottimismo, inteso come l'aspettarsi il successo delle proprie imprese, è un sentimento per cui ho sempre provato rispetto, perché migliora la qualità percepita dell'esistenza, almeno finché non interviene la statistica a smentirlo; ma la speranza vissuta nella fede non è la semplice fiducia nel fatto che le cose che facciamo andranno a buon fine. È piuttosto la certezza che fare determinate cose abbia un senso a prescindere dal modo in cui andranno a finire. Dall'altra parte, la fede senza speranza è di certo meno ingenua del puro ottimismo, ma ha la faccia rinsecchita del tradizionalismo, si presenta cioè come una gravosa manutenzione di abitudini durate a lungo.” ― Michela Murgia, God Save the Queer: Catechismo femminista"
"“I read up on Buddhist stories and parables. One concerns a farmer who wakes up to find that his horse has run off. The neighbors come by and say, “Too bad. Such awful luck."" The farmer says, ""Maybe."" The next day, the horse returns with a few other horses. The neighbors congratulate the farmer on his reversal of fortune. ""Maybe,"" the farmer says. When his son tries to ride on the new horses, he breaks his leg, and the neighbors offer condolences. ""Maybe,"" the farmer says. And the next day, when army officials come to draft the son—and don't take him because of his broken leg—everyone is happy. ""Maybe,"" the farmer says. I have heard stories like this before. They are beautiful in their simplicity and surrender to the universe. I wonder if I could be attached to something so detached. I don't know. Maybe.” ― Mitch Albom, Have a Little Faith: a True Story"

"“How can I—how can any of us—let you go? You are woven through us, from birth to death. You educated me, married us, comforted us. You stood at our mileposts, our weddings, our funerals.

"“Especially in the cause of mission, Christians must be sensitive to language—every bit as much as foreign missionaries must be sensitive to language in their crosscultural contexts.

It might be just considerate.” ― John G. Stackhouse Jr., Woke: An Evangelical Guide to Postmodernism, Liberalism, Critical Race Theory, and More"
"“God’s plans for me are greater than my dreams” ― Alexander Semenyuk"
"“I should say that there is such a thing as arrested development in human things (and a very bad thing it is) when people refuse to think for themselves and look around for some human authority to tell them what to think. Such people are afraid of the responsibilities of growing up. They want to remain children for ever - like the loathsome Peter Pan. What is wrong with such people is that when they have an opportunity of thinking for themselves they refuse it and cling to their faith. They are offered a higher and more mature way of knowing, but they won't have it. In divine things, however, this is not the situation. These are things that we cannot know any other way expect by having faith in the teacher, God, who tells us about them. They are not things we could find out for ourselves. They are not the kind of things we could naturally know. Our knowledge of them is super-natural. We are not refusing an offered opportunity, we are not avoiding a higher, more grown-up approach, because there is in this life no higher way available. The boy who refuses to have faith in the teacher may be acquiring a grown-up critical sense and beginning to think for himself, or he may be simply refusing to learn. I imagine it must be one of a teacher's most difficult jobs to decide which of these is happening.” ― Herbert McCabe, Faith Within Reason"
"“The divine life does indeed grow in us even on earth, but we never reach full maturity; we never dispense with faith until we actually see God face to face. Now the question is: what is the relation between this divine life (and divine knowledge that we call faith) and human life (and human knowledge)? Some people have held that they are actually opposed to each other. You know that kind of person who thinks that you can't be a saint unless you're very slightly ill; this sort of person tends also to think that you can't have faith unless what you believe is humanly incredible. They think of faith not as a matter of knowing or of learning, but rather as a matter of courage, a leap into the unknown, a quixotic championing of the absurd. Now faith is certainly a leap into the unknown in the sense that what you believe is something that cannot be known by ordinary human power. But it is a leap which precisely tries to make this known. It is not a rejection of knowledge, it is an effort to know more - to get to know more by trusting in a teacher.” ― Herbert McCabe, Faith Within Reason"
"“Think some more about the very young child. First of all, her faith that she is loved is not something that she works out by assessing her world and coming to a conclusion. It is something given, taken for granted (in the literal sense). Indeed, if it is not granted, if she is deprived of the belief that she is loved, she will not even be able to assess her world at all. She will go more or less crazy. The child doesn't arrive at or achieve her belief that she is loved. It is a precious gift which is just there, like the gift of life itself. But it can, of course, be destroyed. It is notoriously possible for adults, and especially parents, to erode a child's faith, to leave the child insecure and uncertain that she is loved, uncertain therefore of her own value, uncertain that she matters. The love of parents, and later of other friends may fail; they may betray us. Indeed, I think we have a whole society (known as the Free World) which is so structured as to destroy belief in love, to eat away at the confidence people have in each other, to replace friendship by competitiveness, generosity by domination and submission, community by national security, love by fear.” ― Herbert McCabe, Faith Within Reason"
"“The object of theology is to see the traditional teachings of the church as a unified whole, unified around the gospel that God loves us. Only when we see what the church teaches about sin or grace or the eucharist or the Trinity as all part of a revelation of the love of God - only when we see this - do we begin to understand these doctrines. And the only way to see this is to question them and to question our understanding of them.” ― Herbert McCabe, Faith Within Reason"

"“We hope that as Christians we mature and grow and become more and more like Christ. But the church and its wisdom assumes we will fail even after our baptism. The church presumes that life is long and zeal fades not just for some of us but for all.

"“It seemed to be a necessary ritual that he should prepare himself for sleep by meditating under the solemnity of the night sky. Sometimes, if they were awake, they would hear him at a late hour pacing up and down the paths. Peaceful in his solitude, adoring, matching the tranquility of the heavens with the tranquility of his own heartbeat, ravished in the shadows by the visible and invisible splendours of God, he opened his spirit to the thoughts coming from the Unknown. At those moments, when he offered up his heart in the hour when the night flowers offer up their scent, himself illumined in the bestarred night and unfolding in ecstasy amid the universal radiance of creation, he could not perhaps have said what took place in his spirit, what went out from him and what entered in: a mysterious transaction between the infinity of the soul and the infinity of the universe.” ― Victor Hugo, Les Misérables"
"“What more could he need, this old man whose little leisure was divided between daytime gardening and night-time contemplation? Was not that narrow space with the sky its ceiling room enough for the worship of God in the most delicate of His works and in the most sublime?

"“Does your need seem big to you? Then make sure God knows how big it looks to your eyes, and He will treat it as such. He will never belittle it, however trivial. He will not laugh at it, or at us. He never forgets how large our problems look to us.” ― Corrie ten Boom, Don't Wrestle, Just Nestle"
"“If the Talmud was built on the purported word of God, that word struck you as suspiciously human, with ambiguities and layers of meaning and all the arbitrariness of human language. The very idea of faith suggested something man-made--the idea that we must submit to conviction, rather than simply behold the universe in its natural order.” ― Shulem Deen, All Who Go Do Not Return"
"“The faithful soul finds its good in everything that affects it” ― A. Carthusian, The Prayer of Love and Silence"
"“Buddha’s teachings are scientific methods to solve the problems of all living beings permanently. ... For Buddhists, faith in Buddha Shakyamuni is their spiritual life; it is the root of all Dharma realizations. If we have deep faith in Buddha we shall naturally develop the strong wish to practise his teachings. With this wish we shall definitely apply effort in our Dharma practice, and with strong effort we shall accomplish permanent liberation from the suffering of this life and countless future lives.” ― Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, Modern Buddhism: The Path of Compassion and Wisdom"
"“La fede è cultura, non natura, quindi c'è stato di sicuro un tempo in cui credente non lo ero ancora, ma dentro una trappola articolata come quella dell'educazione di un essere umano in comunità, che comincia dalla nascita e non molla la presa in nessuno dei momenti della crescita, capire dove hanno inizio le cose è complicato. Mi è dispiaciuto che i miei genitori non abbiano aspettato raggiungessi l'età della ragione per istruirmi alla fede, perché in fondo penso che il battesimo neonatale, prescindendo dal consenso, sia una specie particolare di violenza su minore.” ― Michela Murgia, God Save the Queer: Catechismo femminista"
"“Senza maschiIl cristianesimo cattolico, per quanto nella dottrina sia saldamente in mano ai maschi, nella prassi parrocchiale ha attratto soprattutto donne e bambini, il che dice già tanto del fatto che il suo messaggio presenti forse più contraddizioni con un certo modo di pensare la maschilità che non con il femminismo.Perché un culto riconosciuto come strutturalmente maschilista attira cosí poco i maschi? Perché secondo una certa idea di virilità l'uomo deve vivere la fede con pudore e riserbo, quasi vergognandosene. La maschilità tossica non ammette che manifesti in maniera troppo aperta gesti ispirati alla misericordia, alla dolcezza d'animo, alla cura e alla volontà di perdono, considerate mollezze di cuore delle femmine. Il cristianesimo, col suo Gesú morto inchiodato alla croce o il cuore esposto grondante sangue, non è una religione per maschi alfa.” ― Michela Murgia, God Save the Queer: Catechismo femminista"

"“Calaine lifted her chin a smidge and resisted the urge to smooth her hands over her skirt. Ma always said one’s personality made the outfit—a sour disposition made the prettiest silk look unsightly, but a pleasing smile could cause the rattiest homespun dress to look like an elegant gown. So, instead of returning the man’s glare, she offered a tiny smile. She would win him over, this crabby curmudgeon, and work for his unpleasant self until she raised enough money for Jared’s cure.” ― Madisyn Carlin, A Silent Hope"

"“Pray the Rosary every day to achieve peace for the world and the end of the war,' said Our Lady on May 13, 1917. This insistent recommendation was not only for the three poor and humble children; it is a call to the whole world, to all souls, to all humanity, believers and unbelievers, because Faith is a gift from God and we are to ask Him for it: ‘ask and you shall receive.’ You who have no Faith, ask it of God and He will grant it, because you who have no Faith have a soul that you need to save so that you will not be eternally miserable.” ― Carmel of Saint Teresa Coimbra Portugal, A Pathway Under the Gaze of Mary: Biography of Sister Maria Lucia of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart"

"“Humans are complex creatures. Saying one thing yet doing another. Filled with faith yet doubting. Trusting one minute, suspicious the next.” ― Lisa Medved, The Engraver's Secret"
"“Listen well Ghini. Belief, faith, and trust . . . all three are things that’re incredibly different, but get mixed up. You can choose to believe in something like God or monsters. You can have faith that God looks out for you, and that locking yer door keeps ya safe from the monsters. Trust is different. You trust the clergy to guide your faith, not because they have to, but because they want to. You trust that the silver bullet does the trick against the monster, not because you have to, but because that’s how others tell you they stopped it before you.If you don’t want to believe Bernie, well that’s yours to decide, but I tell you what, there’s plenty of this world that we don’t understand. Yet, all us adults got a parental instinct. One that’s programmed into us through evolution. And this old man’s instincts believe that kid. I have faith that he is a good man and wouldn’t try to dupe me like that. But most importantly, I trust him with my life.” ― A.J. Humphreys, Spring"
"“Faith, unity, and discipline remain meaningless wherever the judiciary, political figures, people, and officials eliminate fairness and honesty from their lives and the system.” ― Ehsan Sehgal"
"“Усе суспільство може повірити в міф, повірити й передати його наступним поколінням. Боги, феї, відьми - віра у річ не робить її справжньою. Террани століттями вірили в те що Земля пласка.” ― Philip K. Dick, Повне зібрання короткої прози. Том 3"
"“The uneasy conscience that many Christians have, and the anxiety based on it, do not come about because they are sinners and backsliders but because they have stopped believing in the truth and efficacy of their beliefs; they measure the power of faith by their own weakness, they project God's world into their own psychological makeup instead of letting God measure them. They do something that Christians are forbidden to do; they observe faith from the outside; they doubt the power of hope; they deprive themselves of the power of love; and they lie down to rest in the chasm between the demands of Christianity and their own failure, in a chasm that, for a Christian, is no place at all. Is it any wonder that anxiety seizes them on account of this placelessness?” ― Hans Urs von Balthasar, The Christian and Anxiety"
"“Jesus…could save us without dying on the Cross… a prayer offered to His Eternal Father would be… of infinite value. [It] would therefore be sufficient for the salvation of the world and of a thousand worlds. But what was sufficient for redemption was not sufficient for love.” ― St Alphonsus Liguori"
"“When great difficulty arises, we tend to remember that what really matters are essential, earthy things, giving and receiving a glass of water, a cup of tea, taking the next breath. It is during the hard times that we notice that life is constantly offering itself to us.” ― Tracy Cochran, Presence: The Art of Being at Home in Yourself"
"“But is not Christ a general direction? asked the elder. What other kind of direction do you seek? And how do you even understand the journey anyway? As the vast expanses you left behind? You made it to Jerusalem with your questions, though you could have asked them from the Kirillov Monastery. I am not saying wandering is useless there is a point to it. Do not become like your beloved Alexander who had a journey but had no goal. And do not be enamored of excessive horizontal motion.Then what should I be enamored of? asked Arseny.Vertical motion, answered the elder, pointing above.” ― Eugene Vodolazkin, Laurus"

"“There are only two alternatives about prayer: Either God answers prayer, or He does not. If He does not answer prayer, it is foolish to pray. And if He does answer prayer, it is foolish not to pray.” ― Derek Prince, Secrets of a Prayer Warrior"
"“But killing the possibility of debate is what kills the faith. The debate keeps the conversation at the center of the community. Ending the debate, getting to the right answer, is not the prime directive in the spiritual life. You can tussle with each other and with God (and win!), and it’s all good. The back-and-forth with the Bible is where God is found. Enter the dialogue and you find God waiting for you, laughing with delight, ready to be a part of that back-and-forth.” ― Peter Enns, The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It"
"“Today man believes there is nothing in him, so he accepts anything, even if he knows it to be bad, in order to find himself at one with others, in order not to be alone. As long as he believes this, there is little one can reproach in his behavior. . . . But suppose one . . . . can live without outside pressure, suppose one can create one’s own inner tension—then it is not true that there is nothing in man. To take this risk would be an act of faith.” ― Czesław Miłosz, The Captive Mind"
"“He had a peanut the shape of a peanut on his back too and so was nutty through and through.” ― Molly Arbuthnott, Peanut the Hamster"
"“I don't know how my mom was so unstoppable despite all that stuff happening. I dunno. Maybe it's anticipation. Hope. The anticipation that the God who listens in love will one day speak justice. The hope that some final fantasy will come to pass that will make everything sad untrue.” ― Daniel Nayeri, Everything Sad Is Untrue"
"“And whenever you look back and realize something was the last of something - like the last moment you ever saw your grandfather's house or the smell of the street you lived on or Orich bars or whatever - it can be an ordinary thing, but it also becomes the only thing you have, the clearest memory, and it gains all this extra meaning.” ― Daniel Nayeri, Everything Sad Is Untrue"
"“Some people don’t even want to drink,aren’t tempted by the pools of liquorall around them. This seemsa selfishness. God loves the hungrymore than the full.

Do you feel summoned?Do you feel heaven closing itselfto you like a clamshell snapping shut?” ― Kaveh Akbar, Calling a Wolf a Wolf"
"“لا شيء يقوي إيماننا كالخوف واليقين من أننا تحت وطأة تهديد ما. حين نشعر بأننا ضحايا، تصبح كل تحركاتنا ومعتقداتنا مشروعة، حتى لو كانت قابلة للنقاش. فنرى خصومنا، أو جيراننا بالأحرى، على أنهم ليسو من مستوانا فيصبحون أعداءنا، لا نرى أنفسنا كغزاة معتدين، بل كأشاوس مدافعين. الحسد والجشع، والضغينة التي تدفعنا، تكتسي برداء القداسة؛ إذ نبرّر هجومنا بالدفاع عن أنفسنا، فالشر والخطر يكمنان دومًا في الآخرين. والخوف يرشد خطواتنا نحو التعلق بالإيمان، الخوف من أن نخسر هوياتنا، وحياتنا، وأحوالنا وإيماننا. الخوف هو البارود، والحقد هو الفتيل، والعقيدة، في نهاية المطاف، ليست سوى عود ثقاب مشتعل.” ― كارلوس زافون, The Angel's Game"

"“If we take the widest and wisest view of a Cause, there is no such thing as a Lost Cause because there is no such thing as a Gained Cause. We fight for lost causes because we know that our defeat and dismay may be the preface to our successors' victory, though that victory itself will be temporary; we fight rather to keep something alive than in the expectation that anything will triumph.” ― T.S. Eliot, For Lancelot Andrewes: Essays Ancient & Modern"
"“The UFO abduction syndrom portrays, it seems to me, a banal Universe. The form of the supposed aliens is marked by a failure of the imagination and a preoccupation with human concerns. Not a single being presented in all these accounts is as astonishing as a cockatoo would be if you had never before beheld a bird.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"
"“Here in Oklahoma, I understand why - why humans would sit behind a glass window and look in the faces of families running away from danger and dead sheep, and not feel anything. They think we're bad people who will come and take their stuff.” ― Daniel Nayeri, Everything Sad Is Untrue"

The Being who thrives on Love, who breathes in Love, who is the very Source of Love would know how to find you the Love that's always the sacred thread to your Soul.

"“After misapprehended natural events and hoaxes and psychological aberrations are removed from the data set, is there any residue of very credible but extremely bizarre cases, especially ones supported by physical evidence? Is there a ""signal"" hiding in all that noise? In my view, no signal has been detected. There are reliably reported cases that are unexotic, and exotic cases that are unreliable. There are no cases - despite well over a million UFO reports since 1947 - in which something so strange that it could only be an extraterrestrial spacecraft is reported so reliably that misapprehension, hoax, or hallucination can be reliably excluded.” ― Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"

"“Faith is clearly not enough for many people. They crave hard evidence, scientific proof. They long for the scientific seal of approval, but are unwilling to put up with the rigorous standards of evidence that impart credibility to that seal.

"“These are the things that gave [Jesus] such faith and fearlessness in His work. He knew that the call to do it had come from God, and He knew that He was immortal until it was done. This was what made Him, with all His self-consciousness and originality, the pattern of meekness and submission, for He was forever bringing every thought and wish into obedience to His Father’s will.This was the secret of the peace and majestic calmness that imparted such a stateliness to His demeanour in the most difficult hours of life. He knew that the worst that could happen to Him was His Father’s will for Him, and that was enough.” ― James Stalker, The Life of Jesus Christ: A Biographical Overview of the Life of Christ"
"“To believe that God—at least this God—exists is to believe that you as a person now stand in the presence of God as a Person. What would, a moment before, have been variations in opinion, now become variations in your personal attitude to a Person.

"“Bitterness will rot out your soul. . . You may never get the answer on this side of life to the why. So it’s much better to ask the question, ‘Now that I’m in this place, Lord, what do you want me to do?” ― Elizabeth Musser, By Way of the Moonlight"
"“Life ain’t fair. It’s brutal sometimes. . . faith don’t stop the horrible things. But faith helps you walk through those things, whipped and angry and screaming on the inside. Lord don’t mind our screaming and raging. He done shown us how to do it in those psalms of his that King David wrote.” ― Elizabeth Musser, By Way of the Moonlight"
"“I don’t want to imagine great things, for that requires nothing more than imagination. Rather, I want to create great things, for that will require that I exercise faith in my imagination.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"

"“Some people will try to convince you to believe what they believe and ridicule you when you don’t.” ― Wayne Gerard Trotman"
"“The possibility of alleviating her burdens by a greater faith became lodged in her mind. She gave herself up to it. It did help. And the beauty of leaning on the wisdom of God, of trusting, gave her a queer sort of satisfaction. Faith was really quite easy. One had only to yield. To ask no questions. The more weary, the more weak, she became, the easier it was. Her religion was to her a kind of protective coloring, shielding her from the cruel light of an unbearable reality.” ― Nella Larsen, Quicksand"
"“My faith compelled me to do what I did. I wanted to live by my faith.” ― Horst Schmidt , Death Always Came on Mondays"
"“This indifference is what I want to fight; we cannot just allow these things to repeat themselves again. This is why I feel it so important to show that even in those terrible times, there were people who had a faith so strong that they were willing to go into prison or concentration camps for it. And who were even executed due to what they believed.” ― Horst Schmidt, Death Always Came on Mondays"
"“Faith, hope, and love, Paul had written, but the greatest of these is love. Faith and hope were very important to Anna. But she could see Paul’s point in a way she hadn’t before. Love didn’t need anything else. It didn’t need a common belief, or a common identity.” ― James S.A. Corey, Abaddon’s Gate"

"“Despite all the obstacles we had to face regularly, we were guided by fundamental values that made our paths less painful. Honor, faith, respect, benevolence, fellowship, and, above all, family unity were cherished tenets, deeply revered, and held their value. In today's society, they are fading away slowly, and if we don't defend them now, they will, without fail, disappear.” ― C. J. Thorin, The Wolf and the Shepherd"
"“It is your senses and your imagination that are going to attack belief. Here, as in the New Testament, the conflict is not between faith and reason but between faith and sight. We can face things which we know to be dangerous if they don’t look or sound too dangerous; our real trouble is often with things we know to be safe but which look dreadful. Our faith in Christ wavers not so much when real arguments come against it as when it looks improbable—when the whole world takes on that desolate look which really tells us much more about the state of our passions and even our digestion than about reality.” ― C. S. Lewis, Christian Reflections"
"“I cannot bring myself to surrender to the belief that any ending is permanent, despite the fact that many endings arrogantly allege that the scope of their finality is sufficient to make just such a declaration. I have found that my humanity rails against such declarations and therefore sets itself on a journey (however perilous) to find a beginning nestled in the declared finality of every ending. And in all of my many journey’s (as perilous as many of them have been), I have yet to experience an ending that did not hold a beginning somewhere within the finality of itself.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“Love both wounds deeply and heals powerfully. And we dare not allow the wounds to crush our belief in the healing.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“Love is to bare your soul to a world so rogue that it is certain to shred it. But the coercing hope of just such a soul is that it is in witnessing such a brilliantly defiant act of sacrifice that the conscience of that which is rogue in our world is wrenched free and radically repositioned so as to become the same soul as the one that first bared itself.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"

"“Man is finite, man's reason lives in preliminary concerns; but man is also aware of his potential infinity, and this awareness appears as his ultimate concern, as faith. If reason is grasped by an ultimate concern, it is driven beyond itself; but it does not cease to be reason, finite reason. The ecstatic experience of an ultimate concern does not destroy the structure of reason. Ecstasy is fulfilled, not denied, rationality.” ― Paul Tillich, Dynamics of Faith"
"“Without an ultimate concern as its basis every system of morals degenerates into a method of adjustment to social demands, whether they are ultimately justified or not. And the infinite passion which characterizes a genuine faith evaporates and is replaced by a clever calculation which is unable to withstand the passionate attacks of an idolatrous faith.” ― Paul Tillich, Dynamics of Faith"
"“Lapvona was a lonely place. There was no church, and there was no God to speak of. Nobody prayed. Everyone just talked about themselves and each other. If it weren't for Grigor mentioning it, they would have forgotten about the Christ Child. Nobody believed it was a true messiah, as nobody believed in the meaning of a messiah anymore.” ― Ottessa Moshfegh, Lapvona"

"“Judgment is based on your ego, understanding is connecting to the essence of the person ... judgment comes from a lack of understanding.1/8/2024 Podcast: Your attitude today can change your future tomorrow.” ― Gedale Fenster"
"“Understanding is not a question of keen intelligence; understanding is a question of deep rapport. Understanding is not a question of reason, intellect, logic. Understanding is a question of deep sympathy, or even of deep empathy; hence the central significance of trust, faith. Understanding happens through faith, because in faith you trust, in trust you become sympathetic, in trust rapport is possible -- because you are not defensive, you leave the doors open.” ― Osho, And The Flowers Showered Discourses On Zen"

"“God’s love for us is Christ; Christ’s love for us is the cross; our love for God is loving others; and loving others is to point them to God’s love in Christ.” ― Micah Wilder, Passport to Heaven: The True Story of a Zealous Mormon Missionary Who Discovers the Jesus He Never Knew"
"“This is what I could see for the first time in my life with astounding and undeniable clarity: The express purpose of each component of the law - priesthood, priests, high priests, offerings, temples, prophets - was to point to Jesus, the good thing to come. Each element was a physical representation, a shadow of sorts, of the true spiritual reality that was revealed in Christ 2,000 years ago. Miraculously, Jesus was both the high priest and the offering, humbly submitting His own life as a ransom for the sins of the world. Through His perfect and finished work of atonement, Jesus fulfilled the law on our behalf by nailing our debts to the cross. In doing so, He instituted a new and better covenant - forgiveness through faith in His name. No longer would mankind be bound by the old system of works-based righteousness, but reconciled to God through the ultimate and final sacrifice of His Son. The age of human mediators ended with Christ’s death, and Jesus alone is now our only advocate with the Father. Therefore, I didn’t need this Church’s priesthood, high priests, temples, or prophets. God’s Word was shouting from its pages: Jesus is all you need! He is sufficient!” ― Micah Wilder, Introducing Christianity to Mormons: A Practical and Comparative Guide to What the Bible Teaches"

"“We can only fortify the child on the positive side by giving him health and humour and a trust in God; not omitting (what will much mystify the moderns) an intelligent appreciation of the idea of authority, which is only the other side of confidence, and which alone can suddenly and summarily cast out such devils.” ― G.K.

"“This is a terrible hour, but it is often that darkest point which precedes the rise of day; that turn of the year when the icy January wind carries over the waste at once the dirge of departing winter, and the prophecy of coming spring. The perishing birds, however, cannot thus understand the blast before which they shiver; and as little can the suffering soul recognise, in the climax of its affliction, the dawn of its deliverance. Yet let whoever grieves still cling fast to love and faith in God: God will never deceive, never finally desert him. 'Whom He loveth, He chasteneth.' These words are true, and should not be forgotten.” ― Charlotte Brontë, Shirley"

"“In this moment, it seems to me that talking to God does not require faith, but practice. It is a doing rather than a believing, an act of devotion reciprocated in the same way it is made: mutely, through the hands and the feet, the myriad attentions of the body.” ― Katherine May, Enchantment: Awakening Wonder in an Anxious Age"
"“Liberated from this baggage, Copernicus could posit that the Earth went around the sun. This simple and daring hypothesis explained everything about the motion of the stars and planets except for why God would make the universe revolve around something other than His most precious creation. If you didn’t have to deal with that second part, you could much more easily work out an answer to the first part. A lot of nature’s puzzles were like that: they became much easier to explain if you didn’t have to square your explanation with the dictates of the faith.” ― Tamim Ansary, Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes"
"“The first hour of the prayer session consists of the group of faithful men and women on their knees beating their chests and crying out to god for forgiveness. I look at them intently. Some of them seem for real but overall it's super performative. I do not pray to god for forgiveness, because I believe I have nothing to apologize for and he might have to explain a couple of things to me, so I just sit there, moping, angry, but still trying to radiate positive vibes because I'm not going to be the person who is ruining faithful migrants' experience of community. I respect the role of god in the lives of people who suffer but basically only in the lives of people who suffer.” ― Karla Cornejo Villavicencio, The Undocumented Americans"
"“About Kindness, This is just so much for my Soul, and to each one of you, beautiful Flickers of Light and Love. On this Amazing Day of Christmas, I want to send you all a bunch of Happiness and a heartful of My Prayers but above all a Truth that I feel I had the privilege of knowing long back, when I fell in love with God Almighty. The truth is Simple, Kindness is all that Matters. And by Kindness I don't mean the Kindness that looks differently on another but the One that comes with Empathy, the One that flows through Compassion, the One that roots in Love. We just have to understand that everyone is a beautiful person at heart, and no matter how a person behaves or how someone treats you, we just have to stay Kind and know that Somewhere out there Everything we do, has ripples, so let us create ripples in Kindness, in Grace, in Forgiveness, above all in Love. It is very very difficult to forgive a person who hurts us, but when you embody Kindness and practice Grace as an everyday habit, you soon understand how easy it becomes to forgive, because then you look at the Soul who hurt you as a Soul who is trapped in a blockchain of Karma, you understand that you need to release that Soul from your Karmic Cycle by forgiving and leaving it to God, and actually praying for the well-being of that Soul. Every Single Time, you cross path with a Stranger, wear a Smile, it doesn't matter if it is reciprocated or not, just know maybe you just infected a Soul with your Smile, after all like Pain, Happiness is Contagious. Let your Energy be that of Happiness, of Sunshine, you never know who needs your Soul's Rainbow in a drought of rain.Every time you find some way to do good, don't even think about it, just do it. Especially when you know that it cannot benefit you, because then you know in your Heart you did something just for Him. And that Feeling is beyond any achievement or success, because honestly nothing on Earth is as beautiful as the feeling of Kindness, of knowing that Every Single Day you wake up in this Earth to wear Kindness, that you have a reason to Exist, and that reason is to sprinkle Grace all around, to let every Soul you cross path with feel how Special they are, to Let the World know that Love is alive, that Kindness is the most beautiful prayer of God, the most amazing privilege granted to us. And so I pray to God, today and always,May the Spirit of Christmas be always the most Alive in the Act of Kindness, in the Very breath that we take, for Kindness is about Love and Love is the Root of this Universe in All Ways, Always.
