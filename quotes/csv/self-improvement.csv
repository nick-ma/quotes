"“What we call our destiny is truly our character and that character can be altered. The knowledge that we are responsible for our actions and attitudes does not need to be discouraging, because it also means that we are free to change this destiny. One is not in bondage to the past, which has shaped our feelings, to race, inheritance, background. All this can be altered if we have the courage to examine how it formed us. We can alter the chemistry provided we have the courage to dissect the elements.” ― Anais Nin, The Diary of Anaïs Nin, Vol. 1: 1931-1934"
"“If you try anything, if you try to lose weight, or to improve yourself, or to love, or to make the world a better place, you have already achieved something wonderful, before you even begin.

"“Certainly the most destructive vice if you like, that a person can have. More than pride, which is supposedly the number one of the cardinal sins - is self pity. Self pity is the worst possible emotion anyone can have. And the most destructive. It is, to slightly paraphrase what Wilde said about hatred, and I think actually hatred's a subset of self pity and not the other way around - ' It destroys everything around it, except itself '. Self pity will destroy relationships, it'll destroy anything that's good, it will fulfill all the prophecies it makes and leave only itself. And it's so simple to imagine that one is hard done by, and that things are unfair, and that one is underappreciated, and that if only one had had a chance at this, only one had had a chance at that, things would have gone better, you would be happier if only this, that one is unlucky. All those things. And some of them may well even be true. But, to pity oneself as a result of them is to do oneself an enormous disservice.I think it's one of things we find unattractive about the american culture, a culture which I find mostly, extremely attractive, and I like americans and I love being in america. But, just occasionally there will be some example of the absolutely ravening self pity that they are capable of, and you see it in their talk shows. It's an appalling spectacle, and it's so self destructive. I almost once wanted to publish a self help book saying 'How To Be Happy by Stephen Fry : Guaranteed success'. And people buy this huge book and it's all blank pages, and the first page would just say - ' Stop Feeling Sorry For Yourself - And you will be happy '. Use the rest of the book to write down your interesting thoughts and drawings, and that's what the book would be, and it would be true. And it sounds like 'Oh that's so simple', because it's not simple to stop feeling sorry for yourself, it's bloody hard. Because we do feel sorry for ourselves, it's what Genesis is all about.” ― Stephen Fry"

"“Dear Child, Sometimes on your travel through hell, you meet people that think they are in heaven because of their cleverness and ability to get away with things. Travel past them because they don't understand who they have become and never will. These type of people feel justified in revenge and will never learn mercy or forgiveness because they live by comparison. They are the people that don't care about anyone, other than who is making them feel confident. They don’t understand that their deity is not rejoicing with them because of their actions, rather he is trying to free them from their insecurities, by softening their heart. They rather put out your light than find their own. They don't have the ability to see beyond the false sense of happiness they get from destroying others. You know what happiness is and it isn’t this. Don’t see their success as their deliverance. It is a mask of vindication which has no audience, other than their own kind. They have joined countless others that call themselves “survivors”. They believe that they are entitled to win because life didn’t go as planned for them. You are not like them. You were not meant to stay in hell and follow their belief system. You were bound for greatness. You were born to help them by leading. Rise up and be the light home. You were given the gift to see the truth. They will have an army of people that are like them and you are going to feel alone. However, your family in heaven stands beside you now. They are your strength and as countless as the stars. It is time to let go!Love, Your Guardian Angel” ― Shannon L. Alder"

All these trips that we lay on ourselves—the heavy-duty fearing that we’re bad and hoping that we’re good, the identities that we so dearly cling to, the rage, the jealousy and the addictions of all kinds—never touch our basic wealth.

"“Everything is within your power,and your power is within you.” ― Janice Trachtman, Catching What Life Throws at You: Inspiring True Stories of Healing"
"“The barrier during self-improvement is not so much that we hate learning, rather we hate being taught. To learn entails that the knowledge was achieved on one's own accord - it feels great - but to be taught often leaves a feeling of inferiority. Thus it takes a bit of determination and a lot of humility in order for one to fully develop.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"

"“Never surrender your hopes and dreams to the fateful limitations others have placed on their own lives. The vision of your true destiny does not reside within the blinkered outlook of the naysayers and the doom prophets. Judge not by their words, but accept advice based on the evidence of actual results. Do not be surprised should you find a complete absence of anything mystical or miraculous in the manifested reality of those who are so eager to advise you. Friends and family who suffer the lack of abundance, joy, love, fulfillment and prosperity in their own lives really have no business imposing their self-limiting beliefs on your reality experience.” ― Anthon St. Maarten"
"“A lot of things are inherent in life -change, birth, death, aging, illness, accidents, calamities, and losses of all kinds- but these events don't have to be the cause of ongoing suffering. Yes, these events cause grief and sadness, but grief and sadness pass, like everything else, and are replaced with other experiences. The ego, however, clings to negative thoughts and feelings and, as a result, magnifies, intensifies, and sustains those emotions while the ego overlooks the subtle feelings of joy, gratitude, excitement, adventure, love, and peace that come from Essence. If we dwelt on these positive states as much as we generally dwell on our negative thoughts and painful emotions, our lives would be transformed.” ― Gina Lake, What About Now?: Reminders for Being in the Moment"
"“If the great internet connects us all ... then why are so many of us becoming increasingly isolated?” ― Stephen Richards"
"“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it is actually big. That's the paradox of making small improvements.” ― James Clear, Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones"

"“Depression weighs you down like a rock in a river. You don't stand a chance. You can fight and pray and hope you have the strength to swim, but sometimes, you have to let yourself sink.

"“Lighten up on yourself. No one is perfect. Gently accept your humanness.” ― Deborah Day"
"“...It often seemed to her that she thought too much about herself, you could have made her blush any day of the year, by telling her she was selfish. She was always planning out her own development, desiring her own perfection, observing her own progress. Her nature had for her own imagination a certain garden-like quality, a suggestion of perfume and murmuring bows, of shady bowers and of lengthening vistas, which made her feel that introspection was, after all, an exercise in the open air, and that a visit to the recesses of one’s mind was harmless when one returned from it with a lapful of roses.” ― Henry James, The Portrait of a Lady"

"“An authentic and genuine life grows like a sturdy tree. And like a tree, it grows slowly. Every time you make a different and better decision, it grows a little. Every time you choose to do the right thing, even when nobody would find out otherwise, it grows a little. Every time you act with compassion, relinquish your right to strike back, take a courageous stand, admit fault or accept responsibility, it grows a little.” ― Steve Goodier"

"“It's the same with the wound in our hearts. We need to give them our attention so that they can heal. Otherwise the wounds continue to cause us pain. Sometimes for a very long time.

"“Bill Gates (and his successor at Microsoft, Ray Ozzie) are famous for taking annual reading vacations. During the year they deliberately cultivate a stack of reading material—much of it unrelated to their day-to-day focus at Microsoft—and then they take off for a week or two and do a deep dive into the words they’ve stockpiled. By compressing their intake into a matter of days, they give new ideas additional opportunities to network among themselves, for the simple reason that it’s easier to remember something that you read yesterday than it is to remember something you read six months ago.” ― Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation"

"“If Mike convinces a woman to date him because he is dominant, the resulting relationship will be entirely different than if he had inspired this same woman to date him by convincing her that, through dating him, she could improve herself (though such dynamics might be ameliorated through therapy).One of the core reasons why people either end up in one bad relationship after another—or come to believe that all members of a certain gender have very constrained behavior patterns—is that they do not understand how different lures function (in male communities, this often manifests in the saying “AWALT,” which stands for “all women are like that”). These people do not realize that the lure they are using is creating those relationship dynamics and/or constrained behavior patterns. Talking with individuals who say guys or girls always act like X or Y feels like talking to a fisherman who insists that all fish have whiskers. When you point out that all the lures in his tackle box are designed specifically to only catch catfish, he just turns and gives you a quizzical look saying, “what's your point?” ― Simone Collins, The Pragmatist's Guide to Relationships"
"“If you do not change, you can become extinct !” ― Spencer Johnson, Who Moved My Cheese?"
"“Part of abandoning the all-or-nothing mentality is allowing yourself room for setbacks. We are bound to have lapses on the road to health and wellness, but it is critical that we learn how to handle small failures positively so that we can minimize their long-term destructive effects. One setback is one setback—it is not the end of the world, nor is it the end of your journey toward a better you.” ― Jillian Michaels"
"“We all go through hard times in life. It’s a part of being alive and it's the reality we all have to deal with. There are times we forget our value as a person because we are so blinded with these thoughts of loneliness, emptiness and ego. Somewhere along the road we become numbed with all the frustrations and dissatisfaction. But life itself isn't always about darkness and sadness, Life is also filled with colors and that makes it beautiful. Along this path of darkness there's always light waiting to be seen by our daunted hearts. Our heart is gifted to see this light. It may be hiding behind those circumstances that we encounter; in a stranger we just met at an unexpected place; a family who has been always there but you just ignored because of your imperfect relationship with them; it might be a long time friend you have or a friend you just met. Open your heart and you will see how blessed you are to have them all in your life. Sometimes they are the light that shines your path in some dark phases of life. Don't lose hope” ― Chanda Kaushik"

"“Isn’t it funny how we make rational excuses for being out of alignment? We say, “Well, this ____ and that ____ happened, so it makes perfect sense for me to be feeling like this ____ and wanting to do this ____.” Yet, to this day, I have never met a happy person who adheres to those excuses. In fact, each time I – or anyone else – decide to give in to “rational excuses” that justify feeling bad – it’s interesting that only further suffering is the result. There is never a good enough reason for us to be out of alignment with peace. Sure, we can go there and make choices that dim our lights… and that is fine; there certainly is purpose for it and the contrast gives us lessons to learn… yet if we’re aware of what we are doing and we’re ready to let go of the suffering – then why go there at all? It’s like beating a dead horse. Been there, done that… so why do we keep repeating it? Pain is going to happen; it’s inevitable in this human experience, yet it is often so brief. When we make those excuses, what happens is: we pick up that pain and begin to carry it with us into the next day… and the next day… into next week… maybe next month… and some of us even carry it for years or to our graves! Forgive, let it go! It is NOT worth it! It is NEVER worth it. There is never a good enough reason for us to pick up that pain and carry it with us. There is never a good enough reason for us to be out of alignment with peace. Unforgiveness hurts you; it hurts others, so why even go there? Why even promote pain? Why say painful things to yourself or others? Why think pain? Just let it go! Whenever I look back on painful things or feel pain today, I know it is my EGO that drives me to “go there.” The EGO likes to have the last word, it likes to feel superior, it likes to make others feel less than in hopes that it will make itself (me) feel better about my insecurities. Maybe if I hurt them enough, they will feel the pain I felt over what they did to me. It’s only fair! It’s never my fault; it’s always someone else’s. There is a twisted sense of pleasure I get from feeling this way, and my EGO eats it right up. YET! With awareness that continues to grow and expand each day, I choose to not feed my pain (EGO) or even go there. I still feel it at times, of course, so I simply acknowledge it and then release it. I HAVE power and choice over my speech and actions. I do not need to ever “go there” again. It’s my choice; it’s your choice. So it’s about damn time we start realizing this. We are not victims of our impulses or emotions; we have the power to control them, and so it’s time to stop acting like we don’t. It’s time to relinquish the excuses.” ― Alaric Hutchinson, Living Peace: Essential Teachings For Enriching Life"

"“Aiming to ""demystify"" the ""arcane language"" of the Tripartite Tractate, as well as to connect the work to the more well-known themes articulated in the Christian New Testament, Ropp systematically walks readers through the major ideas posited in the Gnostic text. Unlike other biblical books, according to the author, the Tripartite Tractate is closer to a philosophical rumination than a collection of myths, as it establishes a thesis about a divine Father before working through the logical implications of that proposition. Ropp's analytical approach informs her emphasis on applying Gnosticism to modern life, as the author deeply believes that ""Gnostic faith is not blind faith but reasonable faith."" - Kirkus ReviewsAbigail L, Librarian NetGalley ReviewA Simple Explanation of the Gnostic Gospel is a clear and eye-opening guide to understanding Gnostic wisdom and the Tripartite Tractate. I really appreciated how the author took something that could easily feel complicated and made it deeply approachable, laying it out from the very beginning of creation through to the ultimate purpose of our lives. Reading this gave me a fresh sense of peace and a deeper connection to spiritual truths that somehow already felt familiar, and I enjoyed the way it encouraged me to reflect on my own place in the bigger cosmic story.Sue E, Reviewer NetGalley ReviewIf your soul's been feeling a little homesick, this book is basically its GPS back to where it belongs! I picked up A Simple Explanation of the Gnostic Gospel thinking it might be heavy, but wow—it's like talking to a super wise friend who's just explaining what's always been sitting quietly inside you.

"“In the twinkling of an eye, Cinderella became everything she had ever hoped to be – the most beautiful girl in the Kingdom. Her life was a dream come true, except for one problem: the changes made were temporary. At midnight, she would return to her former, impoverished state. We all feel spiritually impoverished sometimes, and even the most proactive women can get caught waiting for that fairy godmother to appear. Wouldn't it be a lot easier if someone else could suddenly come along and turn our spiritual rags to riches? Waiting for someone or something to transform us into our best selves is tempting, yet how little growth we would experience if such gratuitous transformations were available. Fortunately ... I have it on good authority that the fairy godmother will definitely not be coming. (This is good news for me because I'm not sure I could have resisted her help!) The progress we make in this life will depend upon our own labors, and every blessing .... will be ours to keep.” ― Susan Noyes Anderson, Awaken Your Spiritual Power"
"“A deep question asks about someone’s values, beliefs, judgments, or experiences—rather than just facts. Don’t ask “Where do you work?” Instead, draw out feelings or experiences: “What’s the best part of your job?” (One 2021 study found a simple approach to generating deep questions: Before speaking, imagine you’re talking to a close friend. What question would you ask?) A deep question asks people to talk about how they feel. Sometimes this is easy: “How do you feel about…?” Or, we can prompt people to describe specific emotions: “Did it make you happy when…?” Or ask someone to analyze a situation’s emotions: “Why do you think he got angry?” Or empathize: “How would you feel if that happened to you?” Asking a deep question should feel like sharing. It should feel, a bit, like we’re revealing something about ourselves when we ask a deep question. This feeling might give us pause. But studies show people are nearly always happy to have been asked, and to have answered, a deep question.” ― Charles Duhigg, Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection"
"“Looping for understanding, until you understand what someone is feeling. Looking for what someone needs: Do they want comfort? Empathy? Advice? Tough love? (If you don’t know the answer, loop more.) Asking permission. “Would it be okay if I told you how your words affect me?” or “Would you mind if I shared something from my own life?” or “Can I share how I’ve seen others handle this?” Giving something in return. This can be as simple as describing how you feel: “It makes me sad to hear you’re in pain,” or “I’m so happy for you,” or “I’m proud to be your friend.” ― Charles Duhigg, Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection"

"“Many of us often experience boredom, restlessness, and all sorts of negative emotions, signaling something is amiss in our existence. Unfortunately, instead of heeding the messages conveyed by these emotions and taking decisive action to enhance our life, we opt for the easier route—we suppress them. We turn to readily available mind-numbing distractions in our surroundings and drown out these negative and uncomfortable feelings. While this may seem like a good idea at first, in reality, it’s not.

"“I find it simpler to envision shedding tears over a matter than picturing myself genuinely prepared for change. Understanding my emotions proves intricate. It commences with a yearning to refine my thought processes, a longing to evolve into a superior version of myself, and an acknowledgment of the knowledge and superiority of others beyond my current perception. On rare occasions, this contemplation lingers within me, day after day, gradually evolving from a fleeting thought into an intrinsic facet of my identity. The aforementioned notion holds promise for instigating positive change within me, yet it often necessitates a significant passage of time before I yearn for it, and the resultant impact is distressing. I come to terms with the notion that my heart is astray, preyed upon by untamed beasts. I can anticipate your reassurance: ""Don't worry, no one is perfect.""

"“The value of sensuality is that it provides you with pleasure from the pain of itself.Sensuality touches you with pain, but at the same time, it offers you a solution for that same pain. It’s just like racketeering: “Okay, if you pay me, I’ll make your problems go away, problems that I put on you so that you will pay me”. So you get extorted by your own sensuality, your own desires. Sensual desires hurt, and giving in to them will remove that hurt and reward you with more pleasure. It’s a win-win. Or so it seems, until you realize that the true win is to not be pressured by the desires in the first place. The win is not having to pay the racketeering thugs for your safety; the win is to not have the thugs pressure you at all.The more you give in to the pressure of sensuality, the more you will have to give in since its nature can never be changed. The Nature of sensuality is that it hurts, burns, and pressures you.” ― Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero, Dhamma Within Reach: A Guide to Endurance, Patience and Wisdom"

If you see ends beyond your means, then sooner or later you’ll have to scale back your ends to fit your means. Expanding means may attain more ends, but not all ends can be infinite and means never can be. Whatever balance you strike, there’ll be a link between what’s real and what’s imagined: between your current location and your intended destination.

"“Cuándo la persona que amamos nos quiere a medias, con limitaciones y dudas, la sensación que queda es más de agradecimiento que de alegría, como si estuvieran haciendo un favor.*Una buena relación no permite reparos afectivos.* Cuando el sentimiento vale la pena, es tangible, incuestionable y casi axiomático. Y seguido no pasa desapercibido, no requiere de terapias especializadas ni de reflexiones profundas. *Se destaca y se nota.* Cómo decía Teilhard de Chardin: “¿En qué momento llegan los amantes a poseerse a sí mismos plenamente, si no es cuando están perdidos el uno en el otro?” Si hay dudas, el afecto está enfermo. *Sanarlo implica correr el riesgo de que se acabe; dejarlo cómo está es hacer que el virus se propague.*” ― Walter Riso, ¿Amar o depender?"

El animal hace contacto con la naturaleza; pero tú, además, haces contacto con tu interior. Pues es auto-conciencia, la capacidad de pensar sobre lo que piensas. Eres materia transformándose en espíritu. Tienes la increíble misión personal de conocerte a ti mismo. Cuando te auto-observas y te descubres, es el universo entero el que se observa a sí mismo. Eres un momento, un instante fugaz en la inmensidad del cosmos, pero formas parte de un proceso en expansión universal, infinitamente mayor, que te contiene. Todos estamos de paso y vamos de regreso a casa. Viniste a contemplar la creación, a mirarla, a disfrutarla y a cuidarla. Somos obreros del universo. Polvo de estrellas, como dicen. En nosotros se reproduce la historia de toda la humanidad, y tú puedes tener acceso a ella.” ― Walter Riso, ¿Amar o depender?"

People have these strange rules they create for each other, where they feel everyone must think and feel and act the same way they do. It's scary, letting your freak flag fly, letting the vibrant colors of your soul show in a world that encourages gray conformity. And when you do, some people will absolutely mock you. They will question you and dismiss you and discourage you and even berate and belittle you, your choices somehow a threat to their life even when they in no way affect it.But some other people, the ones who have niches in their soul that align with yours, won't. Those people will see the streaks of color, those unfurled edges of your personality, and it will encourage them to show and embrace their own. And little by little, this world will become a more beautiful and colorful place, one filled with people running after their dreams, alive with possibility and no longer afraid.” ― Tawny McVay, Since We Woke Up"

"“Q. In considering likes and dislikes, how can one separate what is real and what is false personality?A. Start by realizing that it is all false personality, and then try to find outwhat is not. You cannot do the second before the first. First you must understand that all is false personality, and when you become convincedof that, you may find what is 'yourself'. Go on observing. Work beginsfrom the moment one realizes that one is not. When it enters into every-thing, when it becomes a realization, then it is productive work. But when one thinks of oneself as 'I' (the whole), then it is not productive work.You must understand that false personality is a very elusive thing. It is one, it does not consist of different personalities; but at the same time it contains contradictory and incompatible features, features that cannot manifest themselves at the same time. So it does not mean that you can see the whole of your false personality at one moment. Sometimes you can see more of it, at other times certain features of it manifest themselves separately. Also it must be remembered that false personality is often rather attractive or amusing, particularly for other people who live in their false personalities. So when you begin to lose your false personality, when you begin to struggle with it, people will not like you. They will tell you that you have become dull.” ― G.I. Gurdjieff"

"“If you look above you in your family tree, you will see that 8 out of all the 10 people above you that are no longer alive, are likely to have been killed by the same two things, cancer and heart disease. Guess what this means for you? It means you have about an 80 percent chance of dying of a heart attack or cancer as well. Is it wise of you to hope that someone else saves your life?” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

"“How many people are sitting in old folk’s homes right now that no one cares about? That is also a tragedy of immense proportions. There was a time when those people had meaning. There was a time when those people had opportunity, power, vibrancy, life, and attractiveness. When do they really die? Is it when their heart stops? The brain stops? Or when they could stop caring? Or do they die when we stop caring?” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“You do can something, right? We are at the time where we do not have to pretend that there’s nothing that can be done. There are things that can be done, and as Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel said, they’re underfunded. No one cares about them. Poor Aubrey de Grey has been giving talks on TED and at Google, and no one believes. The listeners are just thinking, “Eh, crazy guy. Death is cool.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“Directly attacking the pro-death mindset that so many people have has been proven unfruitful by anyone that’s tried it recently, thus Scivive suggests a more sex, drugs, and rock and roll approach. Give them the hedonism they want, and should want, and then pivot into the correct actions intelligent emotionally fulfilled people tend to desire. In this case, rejuvenation technology.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

Therefore, it’s better to go there with your eyes under that condition when you do the testing, so that the prescription that you get is there when you need it the most.” ― Richard Heart"
"“People thought that what you ate was super important and then they realized that there’s micro world of amazing bacteria in people’s guts and that they’re mildly different.

"“Travel checklists are pretty useful.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“If you picked your top 25 things and took off the bottom 20 and avoided them, because they might hurt the top 5, you would be using the negative space idea. The result is more work on the stuff you really care about. Depending on how far different your 1-25 really were, you might have a top 10 that were almost all the same thing, so there’s a little bit of accuracy of scope that is involved.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

"“Don’t confuse personal excellence with “self-help.” Calling books on how to kick ass “self-help” is kind of stupid, because it’s quite often that the people that read these books are far beyond the needing of help than those that are smart enough to read this excellent and life changing material over all of the other options on the book shelves. Who came up with that dumb ass title? How is personal excellence in any way similar to “self-help”?” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

"“One mistake people make is not noticing that they’re chasing a small percentage difference that doesn’t matter.

"“Aesthetic is so very important now, to the point where women spend literally hours a day every day reapplying the lie that is the fake hair, fake make up, fake lotion, fake tan, fake everything.

How many stupid people have you hired? Or how many rage-filled people? Or how many depressed people? Or how many people who always say the wrong thing? Why are you using race to select between people? Doesn’t that make you a racist? Isn’t there some more important categorization that you can use for humans? You’re better off dividing people by profession, or by their free time activities.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“Very few people can genuinely appreciate a gift and not, to some degree, feel like they have to reciprocate.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“The reason that gift giving exists in the world, and the reason that credit is so powerful in the world, is because it’s the lubrication that causes human beings to get motivated and do things that their otherwise lazy, calorie-saving brain wouldn’t engage in.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“Laughter, yelling when surprised, crying—all are signaling mechanisms built to tell those around you the truth faster and more honestly than you could consciously through speaking effort.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

"“Tony Robbins’s six human needs are: certainty, significance, variety, connection, growth, and contribution. Growth and contribution do not exist as needs for lots of people, because many people are happy with the way things are. They don’t need anything else, they’re happy.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

"“The more you’re willing to focus on a thing that other people aren’t, the more you’ll stand out, the more contributions you’ll make, the more money you’ll make, and guess what? People love to do what they’re good at, and people get good at what they focus on.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"
"“Don’t become Google, and stop training your kids to be Google. You just need to be Google long enough to get something in working memory to create something beautiful.

No. You would build a hut and a boat, and make your life better, and that’s what you should learn to do when you’re learning skills, investing in companies, or when you’re helping other people do things.

"“Scivive will call these the great traps. Some of these could be described as circumstance, lack of opportunity, lack of time, complacency, “it’s good enough”, lack of creativity, lack of follow-through, too individualistic, no teamwork, not individualistic enough, or no unique ideas. We can also be held back by greatness that is too small in scale or learning things that become valueless.” ― Richard Heart, sciVive"

"“Secure Man VS Vulnerable ManA secure man is someone who can identify their own weaknesses and improve. He can accept his flaws and maintain his self esteem. He knows his journey is never over, so he always strives for more. He lends strength to others needing a helping hand. He prefers to take the hard right over the easy wrong. He can handle constructive criticism without bitterness. He can provide for himself and his family. He can set goals for himself knowing one day he can achieve them. He is a multitasker. He doesn't make decisions just for the moment; He makes decisions that he knows will benefit and effect his whole life. If this man makes a mistake he will hold himself responsible and correct his mistake. He has confidence in himself and holds no one else accountable for his happiness and/or peace of mind. A sincere understanding of empathy for others, a sense of humility, and humbleness are reinforcing characteristics of this man. A secure man has faith in the Lord.A vulnerable man is someone who depends on others. He can not accomplish routine tasks or deliver on his own. He is always asking for a helping hand and has little or no self esteem. He lives for the moment without a life plan. He doesn't set lifetime goals. A vulnerable man is either too arrogant and ignorant to notice when somebody is trying to help him, so he rebels against those closest to him. A vulnerable man gets angry when things doesn't go his way. He doesn't only complain, he also complains about what others aren't doing for him. He can't provide for himself or others. You can never go to him for advice or will he extend a hand of help to others without wanting something in return. A vulnerable man can not make a decision and lives a reactive life instead of a proactive one. He knows right from wrong...but still decides to go the wrong way because it's the easiest. A vulnerable man seeks an enabler one who will bail them out time and time again. Others notices his individual weaknesses...However he chooses a life of denial and deflection. This man believes it is always someone else's fault and feels entitled to others hard work and efforts. A vulnerable man has no faith in a higher power and thinks he'll never have to answer for the choices made in their life.-27 September 2012-” ― Donavan Nelson Butler, MSG, US Army Retired"

"“When we are influenced by the nameless Maiden, we can feel as if we are stillwaiting to receive our gift of the eternal wisdom of adulthood. Patiently waiting forthe day where we will feel like a real adult, worthy of sitting at the grown-up’s sideof the table. At times, we can still feel like a child, uncertain, and floundering. An ‘imposter’ grown-up. There comes a time where we ultimately arrive at the momentin our adult lives that we realise no one is coming. No one is coming to parent us,to tell us to clean up after ourselves, to tell us to get off the couch, and get our buttsto work or to the gym. No one is going to admonish us if we eat too many chocolatebiscuits, drink too much wine, or stay out all night” ― Tanya Valentin, When She Wakes, She Will Move Mountains - 5 Steps to Reconnecting With Your Wild Authentic Inner Queen"

"“Book-writing is the province of specialists, living is the business of us all. Moral life, sentimental life, religious life, whatever is above the terre à terre of mere existing, also consists of illuminations which once departed return no more. A diary, a few old letters, a few sheets containing thoughts or meditations, may keep up the connection between us today and our better selves of the past. I was deeply impressed as a youth by the advice of a spiritual writer to read one's own spiritual notes preferably to even famous works. All saints seem to have done so. The moment we realize that any thought, ours or borrowed, is pregnant enough not to be wasted, or original enough not to be likely to come back again, we must fix it on paper. Our manuscripts should mirror our reading, our meditations, our ideals, and our approach to it in our lives. Anybody who has early taken the habit to record himself in that way knows that the loss of his papers would also mean a loss to his thinking possibilities.” ― Ernest Dimnet, The Art of Thinking"

"“In a professional software engineering environment, criticism is almost never personal - it’s usually just part of the process of making a better project. The trick is to make sure you (and those around you) understand the difference between a constructive criticism of someone’s creative output and a flat-out assault against someone’s character.The latter is useless - it’s petty and nearly impossible to act on. The former can (and should!) be helpful and give guidance on how to improve. And, most important, it’s imbued with respect: the person giving the constructive criticism genuinely cares about the other person and wants them to improve themselves or their work.

"“There's a time in our life when we’re about to give up fighting battles that we choose not to tell to anyone. We fall apart, we break into pieces, and find it hard to make ourselves whole again. We tried to start over, but found ourselves breaking once more with memories we tried to forget. We found ourselves crashing to the ground again, and all we ever thought was to give up and let ourselves go. We became hopeless. Love slowly fading, and we started to forget who we truly are. While we struggle to love someone, we also forget to love ourselves. And that is the crucial part.No matter what happens, we should always give ourselves the love that we truly deserve. Yes, we fall, we crash, and we break into pieces, but we should learn to rise again and start over again and again and again. Never give up. And never deprive yourself with the love that you truly deserve.” ― Verliza Gajeles"

"“You’ve got great base stats, so someone like you wouldn’t get how I feel.”Aoi Hinami’s mouth moved ever so slightly, like she was repeating my words, but I couldn’t hear her. I wasn’t even sure what my voice sounded like just then.“Life is unfair. I’m ugly, I have a bad build, I overthink until I can’t do anything, I’m wishy-washy, people make fun of everything I do, and I have no confidence in my ability to communicate. How is someone like me supposed to beat someone strong like you?”This might have been the first time I ever said something like that to a stranger.“But that’s all fine. Because life’s not fair. You don’t get results just by trying hard. If you could, I would, but life doesn’t have rules. No rewards, no right answers. As a game, it’s a piece of shit. If there’s no right answer, then there’s no point in trying. And I hate the way normies like you live. Your confidence is totally baseless, and you go around in packs just pretending to have fun.”With the floodgates opened, I couldn’t stop myself.“Even when I have a reason to be confident, I shy away. When I’m in a group I just feel alone, and it’s not fun. I’m used to this life. I don’t know why things are this way. You have a problem with that? I’ve been like this as long as I can remember.

"“The history of an individual is a mystery to others. It is wonderful, fascinating, and motivating if revealed. The moment you learn about someone's life journey and its details, you wonder and your mind questions never thought such a thing would have happened or existed! That is the individual history of just one person. Imagine how many we are in the world. Of course not only the 7.5 billion current living human beings but also the other many billions who had passed away. Everyone has or had his own life story or even a special event that is or was unique. This is treasure and wealth to others. There are millions of them out there for you to have. All you need to do is to look for them, find where they are, and then wonder. After doing so, it becomes a platform in your own life whether you raise your expectations of things to happen or occur or you move forward with your own set of normal expectations.” ― Isaac Nash, The Herok"
"“My Town is my life is my dream of life. I dream my town to be full of happiness and schemes. I want it to be qualified to overcome environmental changes when they occur because they will occur.

"“I feel the word regret should not be in any language's vocabulary. It is completely useless for someone to regret. It does not change anything that has happened or occurred. However, a person can benefit from what has happened to move on and learn from it when something similar has passed by again the next time. A ten years old child who is playing for the first time with his friend a new Xbox game will never regret losing his trial early in the game. Instead, he will use his first time's experience to do better the next time. Now, he knows how to use some of the device's features and tools better and he knows exactly where, how, and why he failed the first time and will make sure not to repeat what he did the first time. In other words, he will be more aware and alert the next time. Even there is no guarantee to win the entire game or achieve the highest score the next time he plays, though he will do better.” ― Isaac Nash, The Herok"

"“Sometimes it's not what you do differently it's what you do consistently. I approached solving my life’s problems from many different angles. I used to try to be perfect, not in the literal sense, but coasting right below in that realistic level of high performance. That was my desire. It did not happen though, yet that desire did not die. Ironically, as I fell into deeper adversity, it grew. As I dug for China, I knew the comeback would make the suffering worth it. It’s like what Viktor E. Frankl wrote in Man’s Search for Meaning, “In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.” I felt the meaning for my self imposed suffering was the honorable character I would later possess; it had to be.” ― Dexter A. Daniels, Consistent, Not Different: Why We Stray from the Path and Reasons to Return"
"“At times we do crazy things. They make no sense. It reminds me of the definition of insanity, which is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting different results. People credit that to Einstein. I think it is true. I think people are painfully ignorant of how much they do the same thing but expect different results. Maybe willfully ignorant? However, this is a good thing. We are naturally created to do the same thing over and over. That is called consistency. My goal is to align our natural tendency with the ideas in this book, causing an adjustment to our actions which will produce a more propitious “same result”.” ― Dexter A.

"“We fear what is unknown, untill we've been explosed to it enough to make it known. We enjoy what is new, untill it's been fully experienced. We shed tears to that which hurts, untill enough time passes to free our mind. Thus time and absence can heal, but equally so, harm. Meaning, we can get used to things, but also forget what we've gotten used to.” ― Monaristw"

"“It's like what Charles Duhigg was saying in The Power of Habit about advertising, you have to create a craving for the reward. This takes time and doing so is more productive than posting every day and having unrealistic expectations of your followers.

Daniels, Consistent, Not Different: Why We Stray from the Path and Reasons to Return"
"“Rich Roll said you have to be more afraid of your current situation than you are afraid of change. I am sure we all can relate to events that crept up on us and forced us to make changes. The good news is that you don't have to wait until things creep up on you. You don't have to wait until the negative 1% adds up over time. You can change your state now.” ― Dexter A. Daniels, Consistent, Not Different: Why We Stray from the Path and Reasons to Return"
"“When you see the positive results from your time and effort, it produces motivation. Motivation oozes from you while it simultaneously infuses. Ultra instinct. It produces real fuel. Wait, you might interject, how come I don't feel this real fuel when I'm doing well without tracking my accomplishments?! That is a great question. The reason is that we do not see them. We have a bias towards what we are doing wrong. Unless we are deliberately looking for the good, we can easily overlook it, then over time we forget good things even happened.” ― Dexter A. Daniels, Consistent, Not Different: Why We Stray from the Path and Reasons to Return"
"“Asking for help in the military is changing. Before, it used to be seen as weak or shameful. It was synonymous with you could no longer handle your load. Fortunately now, it is not normally seen that way. When your household, career, religious beliefs, Dojo, friends, family, or associates view asking for help as being weak, then shame will prevent you from asking for help. We hold in high regard the people and things closest to us. Those inside our circle, especially our circle that we choose. There is no shame in doing a thing of which everyone you love already approves. In other words, you have to feel like it's not acceptable to feel shame. Sometimes this shame and the negative environment is created unintentionally; when the people you surround yourself with never admit mistakes, never have problems, and never forgive mistakes. These create a negative environment. A better description of it is a misleading environment.” ― Dexter A. Daniels, Consistent, Not Different: Why We Stray from the Path and Reasons to Return"

"“If a parent behaves in a negative way around their child, then, guess what, their child is going to grow up with a negative mindset.This means that as parents we carry a huge responsibility on our shoulders. And yet how many of us can really say we’re leading by example? I worry that we’re becoming a nation of lazy parents. We’re so concerned with ourselves, we’re so narcissistic, that we forget that if we start acting like kids, our kids will start acting like babies. There’s a knock-on effect.Adults, increasingly, are acting like teenagers. Teenagers, more and more, are acting like children. Children are regressing into babies. There are adults who can barely look after themselves. They play the victim all the time and think only of me, me, me. Their kids don’t stand a fucking chance. No wonder there’s a whole generation of children who stick their heads in their laptops or tablets and never come out.We’re supposed to be taking steps forward in life, not tumbling back!” ― Ant Middleton, Zero Negativity: The Power of Positive Thinking"

"“If you pass on through the meadows with their thousand flowers of every color imaginable, from bright red to yellow and purple, and their bright green grass washed clean by last night’s rain, rich and verdant—again without a single movement of the machinery of thought—then you will know what love is. To look at the blue sky, the high full-blown clouds, the green hills with their clear lines against the sky, the rich grass and the fading flower—to look without a word of yesterday; then, when the mind is completely quiet, silent, undisturbed by any thought, when the observer is completely absent—then there is unity. Not that you are united with the flower, or with the cloud, or with those sweeping hills; rather there is a feeling of complete non-being in which the division between you and another ceases.The woman carrying those provisions which she bought in the market, the big black Alsatian dog, the two children playing with the ball—if you can look at all these without a word, without a measure, without any association, then the quarrel between you and another ceases. This state, without the word, without thought, is the expanse of mind that has no boundaries, no frontiers within which the I and the not-I can exist.Don’t think this is imagination, or some flight of fancy, or some desired mystical experience; it is not. It is as actual as the bee on that flower or the little girl on her bicycle or the man going up a ladder to paint the house—the whole conflict of the mind in its separation has come to an end. You look without the look of the observer, you look without the value of the word and the measurement of yesterday. The look of love is different from the look of thought. The one leads in a direction where thought cannot follow, and the other leads to separation, conflict, and sorrow. From this sorrow, you cannot go to the other. The distance between the two is made by thought, and thought cannot by any stride reach the other.As you walk back by the little farmhouses, the meadows, and the railway line, you will see that yesterday has come to an end: life begins where thought ends.” ― Jiddu Krishnamurti, The Only Revolution"
"“Procrastination begins with the little self in charge of your awareness, deciding that it does not want to deal with all the emotions that confronting something might throw up. It gives the standard reply that the self which should be doing whatever task that you are supposed to be doing is not around but would hopefully be back if the problem or task goes away and comes back later. The problem results when you try to press-gang the little self into doing a task it is unsuited for.” ― Stany Austinson, The God Slayer's Handbook"
"“Most people’s biggest hurdle is that the person they take themselves to be does not exist. They are never that person who they think is going to do all that work.

You need to create that person who will succeed.” ― Stany Austinson, The God Slayer's Handbook"
"“We never question the world because at a subconscious level we think that this world is in fact us. We have been taught to look at authority figures as extensions of us. That complicity we seem to share with the world is manufactured and surreptitiously planted in us even as children by adults who do not want their worldview challenged. Most of us have always functioned like this, assuming everything we know in any event to be true. We fail to progress because we do not question ourselves, our perceptions or the society’s perceptions.” ― Stany Austinson, The God Slayer's Handbook"
"“The world creates a self for us by virtue of the choices it forces us to make. We stay wedded to that self that has arisen in response to the world, never making any serious attempt at a reinvention. We behave as if we cannot assemble another self together. We remain oblivious of the fact that a lot of what we take to be us are in fact, reactions to the situations that life brings our way. But unless we realise this, we would never question the appropriateness or usefulness of these reactions.” ― Stany Austinson, The God Slayer's Handbook"

"“I’m even a proponent of listening when you’re in prayer. Effective prayer is when you pray, you say what you want to say to God, then you sit in silence and wait for God to answer.

"“See the Bright SideEveryone with poor eyesight must be a bit adventurous to do some of the same things routinelydone by people with normal eyesight. If you are not there yet, you might be in the future: Many people’s vision deteriorates a bit as they age, pushing them into this adventure zone.Clearly good sight is better than bad sight, however, in my experience, there are some positives to having poor vision. For me, a longer life, more adventure and discovery, and greater creativity and imagination are the bright side of poor vision. I believe my bad eyesight has contributed to better handeye coordination, balance, presentation skills, and enhanced use of my other senses. Poor vision also makes it easier to enjoy a more beautiful world and improve racial harmony. Seeing the bright side makes life more fun for you and those around you.Once you’ve done everything you can to protect your eyes, take care of your eye health, and safely improve your vision, then:• Relax and be grateful for whatever sight you have;• When you decide to go for something, give it a red-hot go, and• Love the challenges, see the bright side, appreciate the advantages, and enjoy the adventures of poor eyesight.” ― Ken Brandt"
"“During the course of an ordinary day, we are constrained by a kind of natural caution, an anticipation of possible difficulties and problems, which tint our consciousness a shade of grey.

"“In your life, there have been High Kindness periods and Low Kindness periods, and you know what inclined you toward the former and away from the latter.

"“Your life is going to be a gradual process of becoming kinder and more loving: Hurry up. Speed it along. Start right now. There’s a confusion in each of us, a sickness, really: selfishness.

Does self-love open a person’s gracious heart and mind enabling them generously to love and genially to care for other people? Without self-love, does a person lack the emotional quotient necessary to feel both genuine affection and empathy for our brethren?

"“(Jerzy Gregorek) is a really wise, brilliant guy. He always says, “Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.” Basically, if you are making the hard choices right now in what to eat, you’re not eating all the junk food you want, and making the hard choice to work out. So, your life long-term will be easy. You won’t be sick. You won’t be unhealthy. The same is true of values. The same is true of saving up for a rainy day. The same is true of how you approach your relationships.

You are the accumulation of the attention that you put into your daily, mundane actions which lend life to your existence. Or character to your daily life. That is you. That is what you have to give. That is your energy. Your big blotches have no power if your little dots are not accounted for.” ― C. JoyBell C."

It seems to me that many who claim to have changed are simply acting differently than before; following a new script that others find more appealing and entertaining. Perhaps the question is posed wrongly. Perhaps it is not about changing who we are fundamentally, but about rewriting our scripts to better go with the stage in which our lives develop, and the audience in front of it. The thought of a different plot and therefore a better ending is, after all, a very appealing one. I know this is a more feasible endeavour than change.

"“Basically each religion has certain practices that form the essence of vedic dharma. Yegyes, literally meaning ‘to offer’, forms the backbone of the vedic absolute knowledge. Traditionally, a ritualistic fire ceremony in which various herbs, clarified butter (ghee), specific wood, etc. are offered to the fire with predetermined mantras (charged with vibrations) chanted by predetermined people (priests, host, pandits etc.) with a resolve or sankalpa, a Yegyes has far-reaching effects that encompass physical, soul, social, spiritual and ecological spheres, causing purification at all these levels.A devout householder is supposed to perform five Yegyes on daily basis>1. Brahma Egyes = Daily jap, daily meditation, daily yoga, offering into the interior fires of prana, mind, intellect and consciousness2. Deva-Egyes = Worship offering to the Divinities, God, the Sun, Devi and Devtas through fire in the Vedic times, through watering and Pooja, flowers, fruits rituals.3. Pitr-Egyes = Offerings to ancestors, manes, and daily worshipful service to one’s living parents and elders4. Atithi-Egyes = Worship offering to guests the word Atithi means one who comes without making a date hospitality is not a social act but a worship.5. Offering-Egyes = offering to God, Goddess, Devi, Devtas and Bhagawan, beings, spreading knowledge putting aside the first food for the wandering cows or other animals as well as putting aside daily before cooking similarly like some uncooked rice, daal, grain, flour, for giving away to the temple, church, gumba, gurudwar, priest, monk, beggar or orphanage nowadays.The philosophy of Egyes, which essentially is: make yourself into a worshipful offering and pour yourself into the divine fire of knowledge, the immortal soul of knowledge.

You have to take failure to a show. You have to buy it a steak and kiss it on the mouth. That's how you heal. That's how you make better decisions in the future. So you have to apply for a boat load of jobs. And you have to get turned down for a boat load of jobs. You have to relapse in your recovery and you have to fall all the way back down again. We all do it and we all suffer and hate ourselves and declare ourselves fuck ups, and losers, and space wasters, and nonsense cobblers, and mistake squids, and we lie down on the floor and give up for awhile. And then sometime later, when the shame and the sadness have worn off a bit and we start to feel a bit peckish, we get up, dust off, and we go get 40 chicken nuggets and start the process all over again. And this time we know more. We know where the traps are and we know more of what we're up against.

"“Mastery isn't about being the best tennis player or the best mom. The resonance of mastery is in the process and progress. It is about work, and learning to develop an appetite for challenge. Mastery inevitably means encountering hurdles; you won't always overcome them, but you won't let them stop you from trying. You may never become a world-class swimmer, but you will learn to swim across the lake. And the unexpected by-product of all of that hard work you put in to mastering things? Confidence. Not only did you learn to do something well, but you got a freebie. The next point is invaluable. The confidence you get from mastery is contagious. It spreads. It doesn't even really matter what you master: For a child, it can be as simple as tying a shoe.

"“There are, of course, real pleasures to be found in self-improvement. 'That the beauty idea is pleasurable AND demanding, and often concurrently, is a key feature,' Widdows writes. The beauty ideal asks you to understand your physical body as a source of potential and control. It provides a tangible way to exert power, although this power has so far come at the expense of most others: porn and modeling and Instagram influencing are the only careers in which women regularly outearn men. But the pleasures of beauty work and the advent of mainstream feminism have both, in any case, mostly exacerbated the situation. If Wolf in 1990 criticized a paradigm where a woman was expected to look like her ideal self all the time, we have something deeper burrowing now—not a beauty myth but a lifestyle myth, a paradigm where a woman can muster all the technology, money, and politics available to her to actually try to BECOME that idealized self, and where she can understand relentless self-improvement as natural, mandatory, and feminist—or just, without a question, the best way to live.” ― Jia Tolentino, Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion"

And then, once you wake up from the stupid spell you put on yourself, you can rail against those narcissists, but it won't affect them. So it's better just to skip ahead to the part where you admit that you're the one who bought the ticket to their show. Choose to want to figure out why you do these things and how to stop.

Deciding is the willingness to do whatever it takes to make your wishes and dreams come true.Pondering on what you are going to do actually sucks up more time and energy than going out there and doing it.If you’re planted in an environment with depleted soil loaded with weeds, your conditions must change in order for you grow and thrive.As you change your circle of influence, your thinking changes, and ultimately your world changes too.When you are too busy trying to outshine others, you miss out on your own inner spark.If your focus is on competing with others, you cannot complete you.Perfection is a myth, a misconception, and just an opinion. A well-tailored business suit might look perfect to a banker, but deemed to be dreadful to a heavy metal rocker.Going out of your comfort zone might be gut-wrenching, but dying with the music still inside is even more painful.Stagnation drains your energy and slowly sucks the life out of you.When you declutter your mental space, just like clearing out physical space, you find valuables you had long forgotten about.Keeping emotional toxin in your head is like fertilizing unwanted weeds.Positivity is your weed killer.Turn it around, and let that poison fuel your passion, just like farmers using manure to fertilize plants.

"“Select people find themselves early on in life, while other people undergo painful stages of vast changes. Some people never exhibit a centralizing persona and they tend to undergo a series of crisis throughout their lives. I observed some friends, family members, and other acquaintances at various stages in their lives and they seem virtually the same person years later. I am a person who cyclically turns himself inside out after crashing and burning, failing, and then reassembling the seeds of defeat into new victories, only to run aground again. I mentally and emotionally resist change and must consciously force a personal metamorphosis. Could I radically change again? Did I possess the internal reserves to weather a period of reconstitution and then make myself over into a new prototype? Can I will myself to becoming the person I aspire to be? Can I take advantage of human consciousness to broker a way out of self-defeat and a misery-ridden life?” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"

Unlike our genetic disposition, we are the sole sentinels of our emotional health.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"
"“The past should never serve as an encumbrance, but we must exploit our experiences as learning assets. The only importance of any experience is to test oneself. Worthy challenges, fused with humility of spirit, enrich a person’s character. One must harvest the grain from their effort and discard the shaft.

"“I found LOVE. But not just any kind of love. During one of my daily meditations, when tears were flowing down my cheeks as if I had been watching a horror movie, with all my pain, suffering and demons, playing main characters in the story of my life, I had felt an inexplicable warmth in my heart. I felt something that I had never felt before. An unconditional love… for myself. I felt that I was more than just a human being. I felt I was part of the surrounding universe. I was a spirit. And in that moment, I felt as if nothing else had existed or mattered. No worries. No problems. There was no past. There was no future. There was only ME and there was no… suffering any more. No more pain, no more heartbreak. I didn’t need anyone else to love me because I BECAME love. I became who I had always been so desperately searching for, whole as a person. I realised that only when we are whole as a spirit, filled with unconditional love for ourselves, that can we truly find and share an immense love with another human being, the one that is right for us and who is also whole as a person. – from ‘Polish Girl In Pursuit of the English Dream by Monika Wiśniewska” ― Monika Wiśniewska, Polska Dziewczyna W Pogoni Za Angielskim Snem"

We can tilt the odds in our favor of living happily to a ripe old age by displaying a high degree of awareness and exercising self-control. We must rightfully display pride in our lives by claiming responsibility for ourselves and by taking on every challenge without mental equivocation. I seek to conquer personal fears and employ honest effort, energy, endurance, and enthusiasm supplemented with booster shots of intellectual integrity to become my personal master. Self-mastery, self-discipline, conscientious study, uncompromising integrity, and ethical awareness form the foundation stones of all religions and these qualities anchor every person of high character.

Carrying a money satchel to demonstrate economic success means little to me, especially if the only purpose of such public display of a purse is to pay homage to a chrome plated heart. I grew my hair out to exhibit independence from corporate America, but ultimately I answer only to a herculean self. I hear insalubrious cries of innocence, pleading lack of personal wrongdoing, but in my heart, I condemned myself for living a slipshod life filled with falsehoods. I conducted a show trial and found myself guilty of living selfishly. I deserve punishment for a wicked lifestyle, but self-punishment only operates to negate personal drive.

"“A person is frequently the victim of his or her own insecurities and latent fears. I need to cease being fretful of a changing world and worried that I will not stack up to the exemplary example established by my forefathers for living life brilliantly. I must stop simply observing life and cease the willful act of disconnecting myself from the pulse of this great nation. I aspire to seek connection with other people, smoother myself in nature’s insurmountable beauty, and work to preserve high-minded ideas and the altruistic purposes this nation founded. Only by freeing myself from a life of self-absorption and by exhibiting profound appreciation for the surrounding world can I ascertain a decisive meaning in life. By recognizing my miniscule place in the world, I will come to terms with the purpose of existence, and only by understanding and accepting my purpose, will I know how to feel right about what I am.

"“If we cleaved ourselves in half to examine our daily mind chatter under a microscope, who amongst us would daringly display the sediment of their innermost thoughts for public consumption? A tattler’s tale reporting the silted musings resembling my tarnished soul is probably the most typical scorecard. Thomas Hardy (1840-1928), an English novelist and poet declared, “If all hearts were open and all desires known – as they would be if people showed their souls – how many gapings, sighings, clenched fists, knotted brows, broad grins, and red eyes should we see in the market place!” My unsavory report card is indistinguishable from the blemished masses. Etched into the end zone of my lifetime playing field are the horrors of gluttony, greed, failure, and humiliation. Recognition of my sinful life led directly to a rash act of despondency. Commission of a ream of sins is a reflection of my weak character. Guilt from leading a sinful life, not strong character, manufactured the overwhelming despair that caused me to seek absolution. The willingness to grade myself as less than a satisfactory human being might be my only hope of ever achieving spiritual salvation.” ― Kilroy J. Oldster, Dead Toad Scrolls"

"“There will be tough workouts when the athlete has to really dig deep, believe, and not give up when the pain seems too much. The athlete can respond in one of two ways: Yield to the pain and self-doubt or decide that fear will not determine his or her potential.

"“I do want something more. I’m not content to be happy, that’s not what I’m cut out to be, not what fate intended for me. I’m destined to be the very opposite. I had more than my fair share of unhappiness but my unhappiness was stupid, barren... Because if I wanted to die, and I did, I ought not to have been so afraid of death. The unhappiness I’m in need of and longing for is different. It’s of a kind that will make me hunger for suffering and lust for death. That’s the sort of unhappiness, or happiness, I am waiting for.There is nothing wrong with this happiness. On the contrary, I love it, feel grateful for it. It’s as beautiful as a sunny day in a summer of rain. But I sense that it can’t last, so it is barren too, this happiness. It is satisfying, but satisfaction is not the nourishment I need. It’s enough to fill Steppenwolf’s stomach and send him to sleep, but it’s not the kind of happiness to die for.I am very satisfied with my happiness. It’s something I can live with for quite a while yet, but if it occasionally deserts me for an hour or so, allowing me to wake from my sleep and experience a longing for something, what I long for with all my being is not this happiness, not that it should last for ever. Rather, I long to experience suffering again, only more exquisitely, more richly this time. What I yearn for are the kinds of suffering that will make me ready and willing to die.” ― Hermann Hesse"

(Hmmm…sounds almost too simple, yet it does sound like the correct formula for me.)Let’s try to simplify: Enjoyment, Love, Satisfaction.I truly believe that each of these core elements not only apply to our relationship with others and the world around us, but more importantly to our relationship with our self. That is likely one of the keys to personal fulfillment: enjoying the person you are, loving the person you are and being satisfied with the person you are.If you are not, something must change before you start worrying about gaps or missing elements regarding your relationship to the world around you.
