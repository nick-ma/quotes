Effective leaders know when to intervene and when to step back, creating an environment where individuals are empowered to take responsibility while still being held accountable for their performance. When done correctly, this approach leads to greater productivity, loyalty, and creativity.” ― P. Zeihan, The 36 Laws of Control: Ancient Strategies for Modern Leaders: Inspired by the Book of Lord Shang"

And both management and operational objectives are made to achieve organizational long-term objectives. Organisational objectives are linked to the vision and mission of the organisation. The team is made aware of the achievable goals of the organization and unified effort is exerted in that direction; on the other hand, the employee whose performance is noteworthy will be rewarded by the organization.

"“How organizations deal with failures or accidents is particularly instructive. Pathological organizations look for a “throat to choke”: Investigations aim to find the person or persons “responsible” for the problem, and then punish or blame them. But in complex adaptive systems, accidents are almost never the fault of a single person who saw clearly what was going to happen and then ran toward it or failed to act to prevent it. Rather, accidents typically emerge from a complex interplay of contributing factors. [...]Thus, accident investigations that stop at “human error” are not just bad but dangerous. Human error should, instead, be the start of the investigation. Our goal should be to discover how we could improve information flow so that people have better or more timely information, or to find better tools to help prevent catastrophic failures following apparently mundane operations.” ― Nicole Forsgren, Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations"

The high altitude workers end up in a state of mal-acclimatization, where they are never acclimatized to the mountain and they are never acclimatized to sea level.

It could maybe survive without a leg or two, and could possibly even stand to lose a couple of eyes, but it certainly couldn't survive without its head. … With a spider, what you see is pretty much what you get. A body's a body, a head's a head, and a leg's a leg. But starfish are very different. The starfish doesn't have a head. Its central body isn't even in charge. In fact, the major organs are replicated throughout each and every arm.

"“If your business is anything like our exemplar firm, or indeed like most companies we have worked with, the projects you have committed to complete represent over 100 percent of your carrying capacity. This can have surprising effects on the length of time each project takes to complete. For instance, imagine a project that will take a skilled software developer six months to complete. The lead time to completion if this person is working full-time on the project is six months. Divide this person’s time between four projects, however, and three-quarters of the time, each project is being ignored by the person.

"“The former head of this operation, Gary Wendt, who is credited with much of the enormous success of GEFS, used his personal agenda as a simple but inordinately powerful tool for growing the business into ever new entrepreneurial arenas.Over the years, he used his personal agenda to make it unequivocally clear that he expected entrepreneurial business growth from every member of management. At every major meeting, the topic of business development was on the agenda (usually in the number one spot). In every annual review, managers were asked to demonstrate the revenues they had created from businesses that did not exist five years before. From division heads to newly hired analysts, everyone was held accountable for some set of activities having to do with creating entrepreneurial revenue and profit streams. In short, no one who worked in the organization could avoid the unremitting focus on new business development.You need to make sure that you are similarly consistent, predictable, and focused, and that you sustain this emphasis over a long period. Pressure applied only once is soon forgotten, and alternating pressure (as in flavor-of-the-month management) will cause people to be confused, disillusioned, or angry. Wendt’s consistent, visible, and predictable attention to business development created a pressure in GEFS for entrepreneurial business growth that took it from the $300 million installment loan portfolio we looked at in chapter 6 to a financial services behemoth with $250 billion in assets under management when he left in 1998.Examples of Wendt’s single-minded determination to drive growth through entrepreneurial transformation at GEFS are numerous. Years ago, for instance, he was asked whether his agenda would change if someone rushed in and told him that the computer room was on fire (implying that his business could be completely destroyed). Wendt replied that he employed firefighters to handle such emergencies. As the leader, his most important job was to keep people focused on business development. Since business development is an uncomfortable and unpredictable process, Wendt knew that if he allowed it to appear to be a low priority for him, all those working for him would heave a sigh of relief and go back to business as usual, with new businesses struggling to find a place on the priority list. In fact, as he remarked, even if he did try to get involved in putting out the fire, he would probably only interfere with the efforts of the highly competent people employed to do so.” ― Rita Gunther McGrath, The Entrepreneurial Mindset: Strategies for Continuously Creating Opportunity in an Age of Uncertainty"
"“SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TEAMWORK1. Effective teams work together a lot. We found instead that smoothly functioning groups work just as well when individuals are able to work independently, yet confidently.2. Conflict between group members is bad. Many researchers agree that this is dangerous. But constructive conflict is essential to prevent such dysfunctions as individual apathy, group-think, and the so-called Abilene paradox, in which members agree to agree, even if they have qualms. What makes conflict constructive is controlled disagreements over ideas (not personalities) and a common commitment to, and mutual confidence in, execution after a decision is made.3. Teams are better off when members like each other. True, it’s tough to work with someone when you have an overwhelming urge to throttle the person. On the other hand, there are plenty of groups whose members would not care to spend any time together on a personal basis but who do leverage each other’s experience and skill effectively. The key seems to be mutual respect rather than affection.4. Team satisfaction produces performance. We found no necessary correlations. When a group puts more energy into its own good feelings than into the task at hand, performance suffers. In one extreme example, an IT project manager was so concerned about morale that she would hold pizza parties when deadlines were missed so that people didn’t feel discouraged.” ― Rita Gunther McGrath, The Entrepreneurial Mindset: Strategies for Continuously Creating Opportunity in an Age of Uncertainty"

"“We could write a completely new manual incorporating all our new policies and spelling out the emerging philosophy behind them. Or we could do away with the old manual and not just replace it.

Organizations hope their managers will lead, but to be a leader, you need not have a management title because leadership is something else entirely. Leadership is not married to hierarchy, an organizational chart, or formal authority over a team. It’s a different animal, with more depth, breadth, and impact. I’ve known people who were little more than the boss of the applesauce, and yet they proved to be outstanding leaders. And I’ve known some vice presidents, executives, and Grand Poobahs—all with high-powered management titles, and not one of them could lead themselves, or anyone else, around a corner.” ― Damaris Patterson Price, Unlock Your Leadership: Secrets Straight Answers on Standing Out, Moving Up, and Getting Ahead as the Leader You Really Are"

"“We ourselves, the workers, will organize large-scale production on the basis of what capitalism has already created; we shall rely on our own experience as workers, we shall establish strict, iron discipline supported by the state power of the armed workers, we shall reduce the role of the state officials to that of simply carrying out our instructions as responsible, revocable, moderately paid ""managers"" (of course, with the aid of technicians of all sorts, types and degrees). This is our proletarian task, this is what we can and must start with in carrying out the proletarian revolution. Such a beginning, on the basis of large-scale production, will of itself lead to the gradual ""withering away"" of all bureaucracy, to the gradual creation of an order, order without quotation marks, which will be different from wage-slavery, an order in which the functions of control and accounting—becoming more and more simple—will be performed by each in turn, will then become a habit and will finally die out as the special functions of a special stratum of the population.” ― Vladimir Lenin, Essential Works of Lenin: ""What Is to Be Done?"" and Other Writings"

"“Some people mistakenly refer to software defects as bugs. When called bugs, they seem like pesky things that should be swatted or even ignored. This trivializes a critical problem and fosters a wrong attitude. Thus, when an engineer says there are only a few bugs left in a program, the reaction is one of relief. *Supposed, however, that we called them time bombs instead of bugs.* Would you feel the same sense of relief if a programmer told you that he had thoroughly tested a program and there were only a few time bombs left in it? Just using a different term changes your attitude entirely.” ― Watts S. Humphrey, Reflections on Management: How to Manage Your Software Projects, Your Teams, Your Boss, and Yourself"

Just as there is no one automobile to satisfy everyone's needs, so too there is no universal definition of quality. Thus, there can be no single simple measure of social equality acceptable to everyone. To assess or improve software quality in your organization, you must define the aspects of quality in which you are interested, then decide how you are going to measure them. by defining quality in a measurable way, you make it easier for other people to understand your viewpoint and relate your notions to their own. Ultimately, your notion of quality must be related to your business goals. Only you can determine if good software is good business.” ― Barbara Kitchenham"

"“Manners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. This is as true for human beings as it is for inanimate objects. Manners- simple things like saying 'please' and 'thank you' and knowing a person’s name or asking after her family enable two people to work together whether they like each other or not. Bright people, especially bright young people, often do not understand this. If analysis shows that someone’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy – that is, a lack of manners.” ― Peter Drucker"
"“Each [co-worker] works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As far as how they perform--each is likely to do it differently. The first secret to effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relationships are as much based on the people as they are on the work.” ― Peter Drucker"
"“There was a point of equilibrium in any organization’s middle management, a fulcrum of responsibility that remained still while the upper and lower ranks of the bureaucracy moved around it. Tyren knew from experience that a shrewd official could find this pivot-point within the org chart and, once entrenched, enjoy near-complete autonomy with almost no responsibility.” ― J.

"“All companies are built as hierarchies, no matter what that holacracy adepts are saying now. It's always a boss on the top and then people who report to him down to the lowest level. Staying on the lowest level is what I always try to avoid. Not only because I have some dignity, but mostly because I am lazy.

"“It is not loyalty or internal motivation that drives us programmers forward. We must write our code when the road to our personal success is absolutely clear for us and writing high quality code obviously helps us move forward on this road. To make this happen, the management has to define the rules of the game, also known as ""process"", and make sure they are strictly enforced, which is much more difficult than ""being agile"".” ― Yegor Bugayenko, Code Ahead"
"“I would compare a project with a country, which is either properly regulated by the laws or enslaved by a dictator whom everybody is supposed to love. What modern management is doing in most companies is the latter scenario. They expect us to love the customer and work just because of that. There are no laws, no discipline, no regulations, and no principle, because, like every dictator, they simply are not competent enough in creating them. Dictators just capture the power and rule by the force: it's much easier than building a system of laws, which will work by itself. The management in software projects also can't create a proper management system, since they simply don't have enough knowledge for that. Instead, they expect our love. Isn't it obvious that rather soon that love turns into hate and we quit or the project collapses?” ― Yegor Bugayenko, Code Ahead"

"“Alliances are difficult precisely because there is no 'boss' in them. They are partnership. And partners are equals, by definition. One cannot give orders to a partner. Hence the secret of a successful alliance is to manage it as a marketing relationship. In the traditional organization in which command and control are based on ownership, managers start out with the question ""how do we get our people to accept what we think they should be doing?"" In a partnership one considers the other partner as a customer. And the first question is not ""what do we want to do,"" it is, ""what are the partners' goals, the partners' objectives, what is value for the partner, how does the partner work and operate?"" Once this is understood and accepted, the alliance will work.” ― Peter Drucker"

"“One way to understand ”socialism” as a social goal is in terms of central planning coupled to a socialization of property. This interpretation of socialism is so in tune with the elaboration of coordinator interests and ideology into a position of power in society, the coordinators became society’s planners and managers that we may discover that …we may, in fact, want to equate “central planning” with a coordinator or technocratic rather than a socialist form of economic organization.

And yet most educated people who go to work in their early twenties will keep working until they are 70. And so they had better be prepared for a second career whether it's in another organization where they are doing what they have been doing or in a new line of work. They must be prepared to learn again. They must be prepared to position themselves. They must be prepared to want to learn- to see it not as something they need to do, but as something they enjoy doing. They will have to learn how to learn.” ― Peter Drucker"

Sprenger, Das anständige Unternehmen: Was richtige Führung ausmacht - und was sie weglässt"
"“No matter how narrow our perceptions become in the daily obsessions of the organization, there is no such thing as a life lived only within an organization. There are other necessities calling us to a much greater participation than any corporation can offer. The most efficiently run, streamlined organization, the best-groomed, most-organized executive is interwoven with the ragged vagaries of creation, and despite our best attempts to anchor ourselves in the concrete foundations of profitability and permanence, we remain forever at the whim, mercy, and pleasure of the wind-blown world.Ironically, we bring more vitality into our organizations when we refuse to make their goals the measure of our success and start to ask about the greater goals they might serve, and when we stop looking to them as parents who will supply necessities we can only obtain when we wrestle directly with our own destiny.In a sense, we place the same burdens on our organizational life as we place on the rest of our existence. We feel there is something wrong at the center of it all, and we have to put it right. We are forever looking for a cure for our ills. We do this by placing ourselves in the position of manager, of thus managing change. Unless it is managed, something is wrong. But our real unconscious and underlying wish is to find a cure for the impermanence of life, and for that there is no remedy. Most of the difficulties we confront at work are no different from those human beings have been dealing with for millenia. Life is full of loneliness, failure, grief, and loss to an extent that terrifies us, and we will do anything to will ourselves another existence.” ― David Whyte, The Heart Aroused: Poetry and the Preservation of the Soul in Corporate America"

"“The search for better, for more competent men, from the presidents of our great companies down to our household servants, was never more vigorous than it is now. And more than ever before is the demand for competent men in excess of the supply.What we are all looking for, however, is the readymade, competent man; the man whom some one else has trained. It is only when we fully realize that our duty, as well as our opportunity, lies in systematically cooperating to train and to make this competent man, instead of in hunting for a man whom some one else has trained, that we shall be on the road to national efficiency.In the past the prevailing idea has been well expressed in the saying that “Captains of industry are born, not made”; and the theory has been that if one could get the right man, methods could be safely left to him. In the future it will be appreciated that our leaders must be trained right as well as born right, and that no great man can (with the old system of personal management) hope to compete with a number of ordinary men who have been properly organized so as efficiently to cooperate.In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first. This in no sense, however, implies that great men are not needed. On the contrary, the first object of any good system must be that of developing first-class men; and under systematic management the best man rises to the top more certainly and more rapidly than ever before.” ― Frederick Winslow Taylor, The Principles of Scientific Management"

The first statement of the Miranda rights is a simple but powerful declarative sentence. “You have the right to remain silent.” Not speaking will not be held against you, but the suspect is told that any words spoken “can and will be used against you in a court of law.” U.S. law provides the opportunity for reflection and protection against self-incrimination with the last sentence asking, “Do you wish to speak to me?” Reflect and ask yourself, it is wise to post or send an email containing that information?” ― Kent Alan Robinson, UnSend: Email, text, and social media disasters...and how to avoid them"

"“If the essential task of middle managers is reinvention, when is that task to be carried out? The answer is, during time that is not used up directing day-to-day business. The fact that managers have time on their hands (i.e., their operations tasks take up less than eight hours per day) gives them time for reinvention. The extra time is not waste, but slack. Without it they could function in only their operational roles. Reinvention would be impossible because the people who could make it happen are just too busy to take the time.Even companies that didn't fire their change centers have hurt themselves by encouraging their middle managers to stay extremely busy. In order to enable change, companies have to learn that keeping managers busy is a blunder. If you have busy managers working under you, they are an indictment of your vision and your capacity to transform that vision into reality. Cut them some slack.” ― Tom DeMarco, Slack: Getting Past Burnout, Busywork, and the Myth of Total Efficiency"
"“We live in a world in which everything seems to needed now and working quickly is normally viewed as a positive attribute in the workplace...Do not let yourself become too frazzled and stressed by doing everything at high speed.As I have coached hundreds of individuals in the workplace, I have discovered that we waste precious time by delaying and procrastinating.

"“When I worked at the W. M. Keck Observatory on the 13,796 feet very high altitude summit of Mauna Kea, we would routinely be engulfed in cold clouds of helium and nitrogen gas as we discharged it into the video camera systems daily.

Due to my very high altitude experiences, I knew that this strange sickness was not primarily caused by altitude sickness and was most likely Sick Building Syndrome (SBS). After reporting various behavioral problems in all of the staff to the management team, my contract was not renewed, I was unable to legally protect the health and safety of the workers that I was responsible for, troubleshooting of this environmental problem stopped and I left in a sickened state for my next position before I could find the root cause.” ― Steven Magee"

"“Although some organizations today may survive and prosper because they have intu- itive geniuses managing them, most are not so fortunate. Most organizations can benefit from strategic management, which is based upon integrating intuition and analysis in decision making. Choosing an intuitive or analytic approach to decision making is not an either–or proposition. Managers at all levels in an organization inject their intuition and judgment into strategic-management analyses. Analytical thinking and intuitive thinking complement each other. Operating from the I’ve-already-made-up-my-mind-don’t-bother-me-with-the-facts mode is not management by intuition; it is management by ignorance. Drucker says, “I believe in intuition only if you discipline it. ‘Hunch’ artists, who make a diagnosis but don’t check it out with the facts, are the ones in medicine who kill people, and in management kill businesses.” ― Fred R.

It is not really accurate to say that farmers grow food or raise animals. Farmers alter environmental conditions in such a way as to maximize a plant's or an animal's innate ability to do its own growing -- in the same way that the best horse trainers seek to draw out abilities already within their horses or in the way the best healers know when to stand back and let their patients' bodies do the work.

"“Truth be told, nobody thought Dell’s direct business model would work, at least back in the early 90s. As Bill Sharpe, head of the advertising agency that held the Dell Canada account from 1996 to 2006, told me, “I had a business partner in California who said, we have a client, Dell. It sells computers over the phone, and ships them to you. I said, ‘There’s no way, who’s gonna buy a computer over the phone? They’re complicated.” ― Heather Simmons"

"“ليس الخلل في النظرة من الزاوية الدينية، فالدين كما نؤمن ليس الصلاة والصيام والحج والزكاة فحسب، بل هو الحياة بعمومها وخصوصها، وإنما الخلل في ما تركته دعوات المتغربين فكرياً والمتعلمنين بغير دراية ولا ثقافة ولا سلطان مبين، من أثر في أسلوب التفكير والنظرة للنص الديني، فخلقت حساسية مفرطة تجاه النصوص الدينية لا مبرر أصلاً لوجودها.” ― د. نادر الملاح, النظام الإداري الإسلامي"
"“التعريف العام للإدارة، حسب ما نرى اعتماداً على مجموعة من التعاريف المعتمدة والشائعة الاستخدام في الأوساط العلمية، هو أنها ""عملية تجميع عوامل الإنتاج المختلفة من رأس مال وقوى عاملة وموارد طبيعية أو مُصنَّعة، وتنظيمها في أجزاء متفاعلة من أجل استثمارها بأفضل الطرق الممكنة لتحقيق الأهداف المرجوة"".” ― د. نادر الملاح, النظام الإداري الإسلامي"
"“لسنا نؤيد القول الذاهب إلى أن الإدارة بشكلها المنظم تعود إلى فجر التاريخ، وإن كنا لا ننكر أن الممارسات الإدارية التي كانت قائمة آنذاك تمثل جزءً مهما من هذه التراكمات التي أدت إلى قيام الأنظمة الإدارية وما نشهده اليوم من تطور في مفهوم وأساليب الإدارة، حيث ينبغي التفريق بين وجود النظام الإداري وقيام التنظيمات الإدارية، إذ لا يعني وجود التنظيم الإداري بالضرورة وجود نظام إداري مصاحبٍ له.” ― د. نادر الملاح, النظام الإداري الإسلامي"
"“نلاحظ في العديد من أدبيات الإدارة الحديثة خلط بعض الكُتّاب والمؤلفين بين أنواع الإدارة وتفريعاتها، حيث يُعطى عنوان ""أنواع الإدارة"" للتفريعات والأقسام مما تسبب في حالة من الإبهام في هذا الإطار لاتزال قائمة حتى اليوم بالأخص عند غير المختصين.” ― د. نادر الملاح, النظام الإداري الإسلامي"

Toyota’s stand is clear—give us the seeds of talent and we will plant them, tend the soil, water and nurture the seedlings, and eventually harvest the fruits of our labor... Of course the wise farmer selects only the best seeds, but even with careful selection there is no guarantee that the seeds will grow, or that the fruits they yield will be sweet, and yet the effort must be made because it provides the best chance of developing a strong crop.” ― Jeffrey K. Liker, Toyota Talent: Developing Your People the Toyota Way"

"“The upper management team had informed me that an employee that worked for me was a poor performer and would be terminated soon. This employee was clearly displaying mental health issues that were causing problems in the workplace.

"“Unfortunately, the board of directors that the middle managers report to generally make them aggressive. Imagine being hired into a company and then being told that you have to ignore the emerging health and safety issues (This is illegal!) and not inform the workers that the system is known to be dangerous (This is illegal!). You have two options: To go to jail for illegal activities sometime in the future, or to lose your job now and have all your USA workplace rights removed for recognizing the illegal activities that your Directors want you to engage in.

You don't need a consultant to make the most out of good-tasting food, beautiful weather, the affection of your friends. Those are inherently good things.

"“~ Персонал ~Менеджер должен уделять как минимум 70 % своего внимания позитивным качеством своих подчинённых; 30 % будет достаточно для работы с вопросами, требующими улучшений или изменений.Каждая компания, вне зависимости от размера, должна иметь четкие цели, не связанные с получением прибыли, цели, оправдывающие её место в обществе.Человеку нужна философия, помогающая структурировать его мысли и направляющая его поведение.” ― Konosuke Matsushita, Not for Bread Alone"
"“~ Коллективная мудрость ~Не важно, насколько знающим или талантливым является менеджер. Он не станет настоящим лидером, если проявит хоть малейшее равнодушие по отношению к тому, чем занимается.Идеальной бизнес-средой я считаю ту, в которой каждый сотрудник, пусть даже только пришедший на работу в компанию, имеет возможность беспрепятственно общаться с президентом.Правда обладает своей собственной силой.Менеджмент силён только тогда, когда опирается на два столпа - правду и доверие.Мечты мотивируют. Человек, способный создать у других людей видение, - хороший менеджер.” ― Konosuke Matsushita, Not for Bread Alone"
"“~ Творческий менеджмент ~Истинное удовольствие от бизнеса связано с пониманием того, что человек, им занимающийся, творчески удовлетворяет важные социальные потребности.Интуиция и наука ни в коем случае не противоречат друг другу. Они скорее напоминают два колеса велосипеда: стоит убрать одно - и велосипед не сможет двигаться.Менеджеры сегодняшнего дня могут сформировать своё видение и работать над его реализацией. Я понял, что прогресс приостановится или станет контрпродуктивным, если мы попытаемся слишком жестко реализовать наше видение или будем продавливать наши идеи.Наилучший подход состоит в том, чтобы сохранять открытость мышления, аккуратно оценивать происходящее и двигаться постепенно, неустанно помня о том, что бизнес несёт ответственность за формирование новой эпохи.Для меня важным элементом успеха в наше бурное время представляется умеренность.” ― Konosuke Matsushita"
"“~ Атмосфера сервиса ~Если вы в полной мере признаёте постоянство неписаного контракта с потребителем и предпринимаете связанные с этим шаги, ваш бизнес получит твёрдую основу для развития.С появлением каждого нового продукта производитель обязан объяснить потребителям, каким образом данный продукт поможет им улучшить повседневную жизнь. Именно в этом и заключается суть рекламы. Её истинная цель состоит не в том, чтобы подтолкнуть продажи, а в том, чтобы донести до людей хорошие новости.Каждый раз, когда с вами связываются потребители, ищите возможность для выстраивания более тесных деловых связей.Потребитель - это король. Возможно, у лояльности есть два вида. Первый из них состоит в исполнении любого желания короля, пусть даже абсурдного. Второй - который я считаю истинной лояльностью - состоит в том, чтобы давать королю надлежащие советы, когда он движется не в том направлении, даже рискуя прогневать его. Искренне лояльные подданные действительно хотят помочь своему королю действовать благоразумно и мудро.” ― Konosuke Matsushita, Not for Bread Alone"
"“~ Социальная ответственность ~Фундаментальный оптимизм вдохновляет нас на работу и реализацию самых смелых замыслов.Концентрация лишь на собственных интересах и отсутствие внимания к стабильности и процветанию отрасли - вот два фактора, ведущие к недобросовестной и чрезмерной конкуренции.Крайне важной становится конкуренция, выстроенная на справедливой основе, не на власти или силе отдельных игроков, а на чём-то ином, имеющим более долгосрочную ценность.Основа успеха в добросовестной конкуренции - компетентность менеджмента и эффективность работы. Важные составляющие компетентности: совесть, трудолюбие и тяга к творчеству. Человек, имеющий соответствующие способности, может достичь успеха в любой сфере бизнеса.Бизнес существует для того, чтобы повышать уровень жизни.Счастье человеку способно принести лишь духовное богатство.Бизнесмены тоже способны внести свою лепту в создание общества, богатого одновременно и духовно, и материально. Для этого 1) создать созвучные такому обществу правила бизнеса и этику и придерживаться их; 2) второе, что может и должно сделать бизнес-сообщество для духовного совершенствования людей, - это поощрять управленческую независимость (постоянные усилия, направленные на снижение объёма внешних заимствований, наращивание собственного капитала, улучшение качества товаров и услуг).Основная ответственность корпораций перед обществом заключается в том, чтобы твёрдо стоять на своих ногах.” ― Konosuke Matsushita, Not for Bread Alone"
"“~ Амбициозные цели и рост ~Только через неудачи мы постигаем мудрость, поражение способно дать нам ценнейший опыт на будущее. Неудача также даёт нам крайне полезное понимание самих себя и обстоятельств, в которых мы находимся.Нашу эпоху часто называют ""эпохой неопределённости"", и это действительно так. Наше время всеобщего смятения бросает вызов людям с сильной мотивацией, заставляя их максимально использовать свои навыки для преодоления проблем и выхода из них ещё более сильными, чем раньше.Жизнеспособный менеджер должен быть готов к штормам.""В старину говорили, что самурай должен быть готов сразиться с семью врагами, ожидающими его за порогом. Смерть могла ждать его за каждым углом, и именно эта готовность каждую минуту умереть заставляла других восхищаться им и относиться к нему с уважением"". Менеджер сегодняшнего дня должен быть ещё более готовым к неожиданностям, чем самурай.Любой успешный бизнесмен сталкивается с неудачами. И в каждом случае полученный им опыт добавляет ему мудрости и глубину видения, поэтому с каждой неудачей он становится чуть более зрелым.Периоды рецессии и кризиса дают прекрасную возможность для обучения персонала. Пока у нас сохраняется воля и стремление к победе, нет лучшего времени, чем кризис, для того, чтобы обучить сотрудников и усилить процессы управления.Ежедневное приращение опыта, как мы все знаем, является важным элементом любого бизнеса. И неудачи, и успех дают нам ценные уроки. События, наполняющие нашу карьеру, подобны крови, несущей питательные вещества. Чем старше человек становится, тем больше опыта накапливает, тем большего уважения заслуживает. Опыт видимо отражается на его работе, ведь с годами человек учится многому. Если вы не сталкиваетесь с поражениями или не достигаете успеха, время проходит бесследно.Каждый раз, когда мы должны принять решение, мы можем выиграть или проиграть. Но, в сущности, нет таких вещей, как абсолютное поражение или победа. Скорее можно сказать, что следствием каждого поражения будет частичный успех, и что не бывает успеха, не содержащего в себе каких-либо элементов поражения.Давая людям шанс проявить инициативу и попробовать реализовать собственные идеи, мы помогаем им приобретать ценный опыт.” ― Konosuke Matsushita, Not for Bread Alone"
"“~ Идеальный руководитель ~Богатство доступно для тех, кто смог приобрести сноровку. Отличительная черта такой сноровки - деловая активность. Как можно приобрести подобную сноровку? К сожалению, я не знаю верной технологии. В отличие от процессов управления бизнесом (основным принципам которого можно научить) сноровка появляется только с опытом и открытием в себе новых качеств. Это в чём-то сродни просветлению.Одним из способов выявления и развития этих навыков является самоанализ. Также важно держать свой ум открытым, не поддаваться влиянию желаний или предубеждений и сохранять способность видеть вещи такими, какие они есть.Компания, к которой нет доверия со стороны других, не сможет сделать другим ничего хорошего.Часто людям не хватает смирения, они чересчур упрямы.Если доверие растёт в смиренном человеке постепенно, оно кристаллизуется в чёткие и позитивные принципы, которыми, в большинстве случаев, этот человек будет руководствоваться при достижении своих целей.Основа мудрого решения - смелость и благоразумие. Нужно открытое не предвзятое предвидение. Оцените ситуацию с точки зрения соответствия более важным целям.Чтобы не заниматься рутиной, не имеющей чёткой цели, лидеру компании нужен идеал, некое ощущение миссии, способный постоянно подбадривать его и помогать ему ещё лучше направлять и побуждать к действию людей.Нужно постоянно развивать веру в себя самого и в то, что ты делаешь.Хорошая работа предполагает долгие тренировки и стремление к улучшению самого себя. Это становится делом всей жизни.Здравый смысл подсказывает нам достать и открыть зонтик, когда идёт дождь. В противном случае мы промокнем. Это рутинная и естественная реакция на природное явление. Секрет успешного роста в бизнесе состоит в действиях на основе здравого смысла, выполняемых естественным образом.” ― Konosuke Matsushita, Not for Bread Alone"

"“I call these lessons ‘learned on the fly’ because the knowledge gained from the experiences connected with them were very much akin to the spirit of the centerfielder in baseball running backward at full speed, looking towards the heavens, trying to not lose sight of the ball or fail to notice the sensation of gravel from the warning track under his cleats as he knowingly approaches the blindside impact of an outfield wall. His focused intention guides him into trying to make the catch that will save the game for his team, his city and the harmony of the moment, despite the foreboding threat of a pending collision. Decisions in these situations are made in an instant. One weighs the purpose of the game, the success of the catch and one’s own safety of survival in a fleeting moment, and in all hopes one lives to tell about it in the glow of great success.” ― Michael Delaware, The Art of Sales Management: Lessons Learned on the Fly"
