Are you hurt?” he asked, lifting her to her feet, the surfboard leash still wrapped around her foot.Her eyes worked their way up his torso, along the plush green towel hugging his midsection.

"“Dare to dream! If you did not have the capability to make your wildest wishes come true, your mind would not have the capacity to conjure such ideas in the first place.

"“So many people think that they are not gifted because they don’t have an obvious talent that people can recognize because it doesn’t fall under the creative arts category—writing, dancing, music, acting, art or singing. Sadly, they let their real talents go undeveloped, while they chase after fame. I am grateful for the people with obscure unremarked talents because they make our lives easier---inventors, organizers, planners, peacemakers, communicators, activists, scientists, and so forth. However, there is one gift that trumps all other talents—being an excellent parent.

"“The people at the center of these stories of power couples mostly choose to see their own motives as selfless. In Elizabeth Edwards’ autobiography Resilience, she wrote of her marriage to John, U.S. senator from North Carolina, ‘We were lovers, life companions, crusaders, side by side, for a vision of what the country could be.’ When she found out he was cheating on her, the crusading together became ‘the glue’ that kept them together. ‘I grabbed hold of it. I needed to,’ Edwards wrote. ‘Although I no longer knew what I could trust between the two of us, I knew I could trust in our work together.’ She wanted ‘an intact family fighting for causes more important than any one of us.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Eight Political Wives"

She added that it was sad when a couple was unable to make a success of marriage, ‘but I feel it is equally unwise for people to bring up children in homes where love no longer exists.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Eight Political Wives"
"“For each of these women, the fear of the unknown — of leaving a marriage and casting off alone — may have bound them to a marriage where there is insensitivity, neglect, or even outright abuse.

"“Begin somewhere. You cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do.” ― Liz Smith"
"“Constantly stopping to explain oneself may expand into a frustrating burden for the rare individual, so ceasing to do so is like finally dropping the weights and sprinting towards his goals. Those who insincerely misunderstand, who intentionally distort the motives of a pure-intentioned individual, then, no longer have the opportunity to block his path; instead, they are the ones left to stand on the sidelines shouting frustratedly in the wind of his trail.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"

"“Real women fight for something, other than their own emotions.” ― Shannon L. Alder"
"“The Trump marriage veered furthest away from my concept of the union — and surprised me most as a student of American politics. Donald and Melania seem to inhabit separate realms and to come together when necessary, when one could not move forward without the other. The presidency was one instance in which they were forced into a joint undertaking. If my choice of language sounds businesslike, that’s because that’s how I’ve come to view the Trumps. Having learned more about each partner’s history, I believe they are two highly ambitious individuals who benefit from their partnership. It’s a transaction: he gains a beautiful woman on his arm, a solid-seeming marriage, a son, and a savvy adviser. She gains wealth and international cachet.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Eight Political Wives"

"“A human being always acts and feels and performs in accordance with what he imagines to be true about himself and his environment...For imagination sets the goal ‘picture’ which our automatic mechanism works on.

"“Even a moment's reflection will help you see that the problem of using your time well is not a problem of the mind but of the heart. It will only yield to a change in the very way we feel about time. The value of time must change for us. And then the way we think about it will change, naturally and wisely. That change in feeling and in thinking is combined in the words of a prophet of God in this dispensation. It was Brigham Young, and the year was 1877, and he was speaking at April general conference. He wasn't talking about time or schedules or frustrations with too many demands upon us. Rather, he was trying to teach the members of the Church how to unite themselves in what was called the united order. The Saints were grappling with the question of how property should be distributed if they were to live the celestial law. In his usual direct style, he taught the people that they were having trouble finding solutions because they misunderstood the problem. Particularly, he told them they didn't understand either property or the distribution of wealth. Here is what he said: With regard to our property, as I have told you many times, the property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same. This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father; all the rest is what he may be pleased to add unto us. To direct, to counsel and to advise in the disposition of our time, pertains to our calling as God's servants, according to the wisdom which he has given and will continue to give unto us as we seek it. [JD 18:354] Time is the property we inherit from God, along with the power to choose what we will do with it. President Young calls the gift of life, which is time and the power to dispose of it, so great an inheritance that we should feel it is our capital. The early Yankee families in America taught their children and grandchildren some rules about an inheritance. They were always to invest the capital they inherited and live only on part of the earnings. One rule was ""Never spend your capital."" And those families had confidence the rule would be followed because of an attitude of responsibility toward those who would follow in later generations. It didn't always work, but the hope was that inherited wealth would be felt a trust so important that no descendent would put pleasure ahead of obligation to those who would follow. Now, I can see and hear Brigham Young, who was as flinty a New Englander as the Adams or the Cabots ever hoped to be, as if he were leaning over this pulpit tonight. He would say something like this, with a directness and power I wish I could approach: ""Your inheritance is time. It is capital far more precious than any lands or stocks or houses you will ever get. Spend it foolishly, and you will bankrupt yourself and cheapen the inheritance of those that follow you. Invest it wisely, and you will bless generations to come. “A Child of Promise”, BYU Speeches, 4 May 1986” ― Henry B. Eyring"

At the same time some southern preachers referred to then-Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris as Jezebel, the Bible’s most nefarious woman and archetype of female cunning.

"“Life will always send us our own Goliaths. They may not come armored, but they’ll come dressed as obstacles, setbacks, betrayals, and heartbreak.Life’s giants will tower over us with intimidation, convincing us that we are too small, too weak, too unprepared.Do not quit. Do not run away.The very giants that stand in your way may be the stepping stones to your destiny. What looks like opposition is often preparation. We are strengthened by the struggle.Goliath wasn’t sent to destroy David… Goliath was sent to reveal him. Without this giant, David would have remained a shepherd boy… but because of the battle, he became a King.These Goliaths of life are not punishments… They are promotions in disguise. They are the challenges that awaken our courage, the trials that sharpen our skills, and the battles that reveal who we really are.Mindset matters… Stop telling God how big your problems are… and start telling your problems how big God is. You are designed for greatness.Don’t cower or run from the giants in your life… Face them! Don’t let them stop you in your tracks. See them for what they are… A divine invitation to rise… An opportunity to step into the greatness that has been waiting inside you all along.” ― Steve Maraboli"

"“Accountability can be hard to create on your own. And sometimes people get hung up on the idea of even asking for accountability. There’s an idea that if you have to ask for support, you must not want or deserve to accomplish that goal.

"“Ask anyone who's nearly died. You should live in the moment. Unfortunately, that's impossible. Every moment keeps slipping past. You can only go on to the next moment and the one after that, seeking out what you love most with whom you love most. All these moments tallied up? That's your life. Bucket lists aren't important. Benchmarks aren't important. Neither are goals. You take the wins in small ways: did I wake up this morning? Do I have a roof over my head? Are the people I care about doing okay? You don't need the things you don't have. You only need what you've got, and the rest? It's just gravy.” ― Jodi Picoult, Wish You Were Here"

Never forget your goal...if you have to take less, don't stay there!” ― Asuni LadyZeal"
"“Everything in life takes time. It is wrong to judge our life by what we presently are, what matters is that we can be more than we are. Refuse the urge to go faster than you REALLY can. Attimes all you need to succeed is CONSISTENT LITTLE actions. Uncover just what you have to do and do it consistently.

"“To insist on a certain outcome--one outcome--is to deny yourself the surprise experiences life was going to give you--the things you didn't know you wanted until they came knocking and you were daring enough to let them in. By tying yourself to an ending, you're making arrangements to be miserable if you don't get exactly what you want. Or worse, you get exactly what you want and it doesn't make you as supremely happy as you thought it was going to.” ― Samara O'Shea"
"“In 2004, I was working toward my master’s in organizational development at Pepperdine Graziadio Business School and decided to write my thesis on the effectiveness of life coaching. Two years of extensive research with almost one hundred former US Senate interns showed what I already knew from personal experience. Regardless of age, gender, level of self-awareness, or degree, three months of coaching increased their life satisfaction and improved their personal growth.The key conclusions that emerged from this study include:•Life coaching makes a significant difference in overall life satisfaction.•Coaching is an effective approach to goal attainment and personal development.•Coaching helps clients be more effective in setting concrete, measurable goals instead of being overwhelmed by large tasks.•Asking challenging questions encourages the client to look at a problem in new, creative ways.I knew coaching was effective, and this research proved it.” ― Darcy Luoma, Thoughtfully Fit: Your Training Plan for Life and Business Success"

You know what you need and want better than anyone else, so my job is to help you reveal your path to that goal.

"“What we witness playing out in the relationships of our public figures we risk finding acceptable in our private lives. Feminists have connected women’s sexual subordination to their unequal status in society, and have strived to transform women’s expectations in their private lives. Private dignity at home equates to dignity in the workplace and the public sphere.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Eight Political Wives"
"“To leave the marriage behind is to step out of the spotlight. It means fading into normalcy, returning to ordinary life, perhaps an impossible admission for women who have built their egos on being one member of a powerful team. To divorce might be to admit defeat for women who have come to see themselves as extraordinary and who circulate with other famous and history-making figures.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Eight Political Wives"
"“It wasn’t always that way for the wives of powerful men. Prior to the 1960s, the press generally kept mum about the sex lives of politicians. When Eleanor Roosevelt discovered her husband’s affair by reading a love letter, she kept it to herself — and used it to gain the upper hand in her marriage, which had the additional benefit of setting her free to pursue writing and social activism.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Eight Political Wives"
"“Patriarchy’s influence often lives in the minds of women who were raised in a certain way and who aspire to a certain type of greatness — as one half of a powerful, leading couple. They act from behind the scenes, from behind a husband, because their goals and dreams, their stature in the world, is achieved most effectively through the influence of men — or so they believe. Without their husbands, they seem to doubt that they can fully express themselves. The motives of women in power political couples may be foreign to women in private life, but we should consider that the women who hold or aspire to great power have unique pressures and uncompromising standards. Does that compromise make sense when the couple can do so much good in the world, accomplish their political and policy goals, and build a platform and legacy for their children and grandchildren? Political women struggle with these questions.” ― Anne Michaud, Why They Stay: Sex Scandals, Deals, and Hidden Agendas of Nine Political Wives"

"“We lose people who are dear to us on the way to reaching our dreams and goals. In the end, we don’t even understand how we allowed this to happen. After a while, all of a sudden, you open your eyes and realize that you have lost somebody you cared for, just because you were not right beside them recently. All these remote conversations, correspondence, likes on social media, all this worthless virtual reality will never replace the physical presence of someone valuable in your life. And what is the result? The paradox of this situation is that nothing special seems to have happened. You did not quarrel, you did not hold grudges against each other, but in the end, you became strangers.” ― Ash Gabrieli, Petrichor"

If you are more concerned about what is happening with someone else, you have given them the power to defeat you.” ― Liz Faublas, Million Dollar Pen, Ink."

"“Life's monumental progress and humanity's energies are always accompanied with the massive expansion of social contrasts and contradictions.It is not hard to understand just how great the significance is of anything that brings a bit of order into this chaos, anything that introduces some organization or contains this disharmony - in other words, the significance of anything that acts as a coercive norm. This is why social creativity in this sphere unfolds with immense energy and gives rise to an immense wealth of forms. It is a result of the harsh necessities of life.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"
"“Scientific and technical rules are one typical example of pragmatic norms. These rules do not coerce anyone to do anything. They only point out more useful ways to reach a specific goal. Their imperative is contingent and hypothetical. Externally coercive norms impose on a person his very goals, or, at the very least, the limits of these goals. Pragmatic norms offer a choice.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"

"“Goals are meant to be reached, dreams are meant to be accomplished but what happens when a man with dreams does nothing to accomplish his aim/goals in life? He becomes poor, dirty and unsuccessful.” ― Popoola Rasheed Olanrewaju"
"“Undoubtedly, externally coercive norms are necessary for the preservation of life among the contradictions of spontaneous development; however, they accomplish this preservation at the cost of constraining this very development - at the cost of stunting and delaying it. On the other hand, by replacing external crude conflicts with inner contradictions that are born out of coercion, they direct human consciousness toward the production of new forms of life and development all the more strongly - toward forms that would be free from spontaneity, from contradictions and coercion.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"
"“While for a philosopher every encounter with a new phenomenon or idea may cause resonant changes and even transform the entirety of his worldview, a philistine files every new discovery into one of many drawers in his brain and then proceeds to lock it, remaining indifferent to the notion that other drawers contain thoughts and facts that are deeply contradictory or, on the contrary, particularly harmonious with the one that he has just compartmentalized.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"
"“In contemporary society, a large capitalist enterprise, considered from the point of view of its labor technology, can serve as an example of a highly organized, rich-in-content, and plastic living environment. In this limited sphere, processes of development unfold rather harmoniously. For instance, the introduction of a new technological invention significantly reduces the expenditure of labor power in some given aspect of this production. A series of further changes follow immediately.This matter appears in an entirely different light when we consider this company in connection with others. The capitalist system is characterized overall by anarchy.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"
"“Just how much more vivid, bright, and deep must the consciousness of the collective goal be in a society wherein this goal becomes apparent not only in exceptional circumstances, but instead permeates the entirety of social life and becomes directly embodied in the organized system of collective labor.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"
"“The struggles between people, competition, and rivalry are all only derivative stimuli for development, concealing the primary stimuli. The latter appear when man meets nature face to face, and when in direct struggle with it he acts as a productive, creative force.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"
"“A human enemy does not push us toward the path of progress nearly as forcefully and accurately as our other great and mysteriously enchanted adversary - nature.The internal social struggle that the individualist takes as the only possible and unquestionably necessary engine of progress in reality appears rather as its barrier. It wastes energy and dissipates the creative attention of men.Man's struggle with nature - the main and universal engine of progress - is entirely devoid of such detrimental side effects.Progress may be accomplished with the greatest speed and energy, the greatest versatility and harmony, only in a society that would have comradely cooperation as its form and the whole of humanity as its limit. There the forces of development will become infinite.” ― Alexander Bogdanov"

It's a sick pornography of existence, distilling the wide range of experience into a few pre-prepared options, with people engaging in the process more to feel important about themselves than to get anything done. When it's time to really find a survey about something unimportant, like what color we paint the city hall, by all means take a vote - who cares what the outcomes is.” ― Brett Stevens, Nihilism: A Philosophy Based In Nothingness And Eternity"
"“Productivity is now sold as a lifestyle. People hustle away and grind for the sake of grinding. New calendars. New dry erase markers. New journals. But when they write in advanced journals, they write of goals and next steps— never of thoughts and secrets. When they write of goals, their goals are to have more goals. So you abandon the empty castle that is productivity and enter the little cottage of your funny heart.” ― Karl Kristian Flores, The Goodbye Song"

"“Connect more. Break the chains.Cause a few hurricanes wherever you go! Connection, that's the key. That's what keeps us going. It doesn't matter who you're connecting to, whether it's the people or Nature or simply with your own self. Traveling to over 20 countries, working in institutions and frameworks that pulled me from my tip to toe from nurturing passions to absorbing diverse cultures and lifestyles, knowing people from different communities, I have realised all that matters in Life is our urge to grow and to leave an impact of the work that we do, even if that is in proportions and pieces that aren't very akin to success. Because the truth is Success is not measured in quantitative approaches to workspaces but in the qualitative impact that we draw around in the lives of people we work with or just engage in our daily communication. Life is actually a process of learning and unlearning, a growth that smells like evolution but actually is more of an adaptive ability to embrace change. We change as individuals every fraction of a second through the connections we make and nothing stays compact or static anymore and that's exactly what knowledge stands for, knowledge of life of cosmos and of our passions. They Grow! So don't keep rigid fixed sets of notions because thoughts and ideas keep growing every moment and that's why we need to challenge ourselves to flow with this process of life, to sail along the voyage of this adventure called Life.And while you do that, keep a heart that feels all, detached but connected. Detached from any sort of bias and connected to the roots of your soul and your culture. Because what you bring to the table is entirely YOUR mark which should look like your unique beautiful self. Be absolutely crazy and passionate about all that you do, be it work or life and let the fire inside you burn so bright that those who connect with you feel your warmth and bask in your sunshine, at the moment and always.” ― Debatrayee Banerjee"

"“We have to be motivated by an inner intention instead of our external goals. Otherwise we'll be a slave to those goals and will miss out on the opportunity to truly express ourselves, create massive value and shift the planet. If you start a creative project like to write a book and you don't have an inner intention for why you are doing it then your mind will latch on to the need for a specific outcome and ask questions like ""how can I write a book people will like'' or ""what sells?"". If you don't lead with an inner intention that is driving you forward and listening to the inspiring creativity of your heart then you will be victim to the external results and opinions of other people. If I was writing this book for an external result I wouldn't be able to do it. Instead everyday when I write I have a powerful intention for unfolding into more of what I am and creating a deeper connection with myself and the wisdom that is coming through.

"“It is commonplace constantly to set goals and be prideful of prior accomplishments. It is rare to take no satisfaction from prior achievements. When I finally secure modest economic rewards and achieve other milepost accomplishments that formerly eluded me, I no longer assign value to the blood works that I exquisitely labored to achieve. Why do I write off as silly all labor-intensive deeds that grievously taxed me? How do I end this cycle of pain and learn to let it be, accept the world as it is, and extend love and compassion to the entire world? Sometimes asking questions is more important than immediately discovering a fitting response. While writing this scroll, I ask an inordinate amount of questions, many of which direct inquiries prove unanswerable. The more penetrating the query, the more time it will take to construct a proper reply. Perhaps I should continue asking pertinent questions about the meaning of life until I discover how to live. Rainer Maria Rilke advised, ‘Live your questions now, and perhaps without even knowing it, you will live along some distant day into your answers.’ Exploratory writing addressing how to respond to distinct emotional turmoil is my first act of consciousness, my first attempt towards achieving self-awareness. Perhaps I can continue writing until I discover pathway to mindfulness, which Jeff Wilson described in his 2014 book ‘Mindful America: Meditation and the Mutual Transformation of Buddhism and American Culture,’ as ‘the intentional, accepting, and non-judgmental focus of one’s attention on the emotions, thoughts, and sensations occurring in the present moment.” ― Kilroy J.

"“Když na to přijde, málokterý nápad je tak šílený jako má oblíbená činnost, běhání. Je to namáhavé. Bolí to. Je to nebezpečné. Odměna za to je jen malá a zdaleka ji nemáte zaručenou. Když běžíte po oválu nebo prázdnou ulicí, nemáte žádný reálný cíl.Přinejmenším ne taková, aby se vám ta námaha plně vyplatila. Cílem se stává samotná aktivita. Ne že by nebyla žádná cílová čára, ale jste to vy, kdo si cílovou čáru určuje. Jakýkoli požitek nebo zisk, který vám běhání přináší, musíte vytěžit vy sami z aktivity samotné. Všechno spočívá v tom, jaký rámec tomu sami dáte, jak to prodáte sami sobě.Každý, kdo běhá, to dobře ví. Běžíte a běžíte, míli za mílí, a nikdy nevíte úplně přesně proč vlastně. Říkate si, že běžíte k nějakému cíli, ženete se, už abyste tam honem byli, ale ve skutečnosti běžíte proto, že jiná možnost - zastavit se - vás děsí k smrti.Takže tenkrát toho rána v roce 1962 jsem si řekl: ať si klidně druzí myslí, že ten tvůj nápad je šílený..., ale ty si prostě za ním půjdeš. Nezastavuj se. Ať tě ani nenapadne jen pomyslet na to, že by ses mohl zastavit, dokud se tam nedostaneš, a nijak zvlášť nepřemýšlej o tom, kde je to ""tam"". Ať přijde, co přijde, zkrátka se nezastavuj.” ― Phil Knight, Shoe Dog"

"“For you, if you attain your goal and cannot find some way to transcend the experience of having that goal be your entire existence, your raison de faire, so, then one of two things will happen...One, one is that you attain the goal and realize the shocking realization that attaining the goal does not complete you or redeem you, does not make everything for your life ""OK"" as you are, in the culture, educated to assume it will do this, the goal. And then you face this fact that what you had thought would have the meaning does not have the meaning when you get it, and you are impaled by shock...Or the other possibility of doom...They attain the goal, thus, and put as much equal passion into celebrating their attainment as they had put into pursuing the attainment. This is called here the Syndrome of the Endless Party. The celebrity, money, sexual behaviors, drugs and substances. The glitter. They become celebrities instead of players, and because they are celebrities only as long as they feed the culture-of-goal's hunger for the make-it, the winning, they are doomed, because you cannot both celebrate and suffer, and play is always suffering, just so.” ― David Foster Wallace, Infinite Jest"

Then I think of the past, even before I was born, the great small feats people accomplished.[...]Those people had to work to accomplish those things, they thought of details, they followed through. Even if I come off as naive and zealous, even if I get on everyone's nerves, I have to follow these examples. Even if I fail, I have to try and try and try.

"“The Latin word finis has two meanings: the end or the finish, and a goal to reach. A man who could not see the end of his ""provisional existence"" was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. He ceased living for the future, in contrast to a man in normal life. Therefore the whole structure of his inner life changed; signs of decay set in which we know from other areas of life. The unemployed worker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain sense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal. Research work done on unemployed miners has shown that they suffer from a peculiar sort of deformed time-inner time- which is a result of their unemployed state. Prisoners, too, suffered from this strange ""time-experience."" In camp, a small time unit, a day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue, appeared endless. A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly. My comrades agreed when I said that in a camp a day lasted longer than a week.” ― Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning"

To objectively fabricate a purpose at the outset and to apply it to a human being was to rob him at birth of freedom of action. Hence, purpose was something that the individual had to make for himself. But no one, no matter who, could freely create a purpose.

A man walked because he wanted to. Then walking became his purpose. He thought because he wanted to. Then, thinking became his purpose. Just as to walk or to think for a particular purpose meant the degradation of walking and thinking, so to establish an external purpose and to act to fulfill it meant the degradation of action. Accordingly, those who used the sum of their actions as a means to an end were in effect destroying the purpose of their own existence.” ― Natsume Sōseki, And Then"

"“To turn the page to the next chapter of a more satisfying life-as-adventure, these steps that have proved fruitful for me -- when I've actually followed them.1. Find Your True North to Become More JoyfulFirst be clear about choosing a goal that rings true. Forget ""should"" or adopting someone else's goal for you.2. Picture Being Your HeroAfraid you will fail? Supplant your fear with a greater motivation. When you are tempted to fall back, picture how you'll feel when you succeed. ."" Rather than talking about what you are giving up or how you might fail, reflect upon and discuss the benefits you clearly see.3. Surround Yourself With Mutual Support SystemsTo keep your resolve, surround yourself with those who want you to succeed - and who are also on a path of practice. Agree on shared and individual behaviors that reinforce your mutual support. The authors of Influencer found that is the only way to permanently change.4. Involve Your Senses To Stay On Your PathTie your goal for your new chapter to your frequent experiences. Write it down. Say it out loud. Associate it with things you see, hear, smell, taste and touch every day. Plant sticky messages on your bathroom mirror, your car dashboard and smart device screen. Smell your shampoo and connect it with living that chapter. Brush your teeth and feel the motion towards it.5. Notice Where You Get DetouredNotice your pattern of avoidance. What activities get you sidetracked? What time of day or day of the week is it most likely to happen? What else is happening that can numb you into avoidance? What colleagues and friends help or hinder you on your path? Conversely, when are your stronger moments?6. Plan A Grand RewardThe bigger the change, the larger the reward you deserve. Enable others who supported you, to savor it with you. Since behavior is contagious to the third degree, you don't know which friends, and friends of your friends' friends might be moved, by your example, to also turn the page to the next chapter of the adventure story they were meant to live.” ― Kare Anderson, Moving From Me to We"

Pinnacles loomed within reach. Beasts were tame, bullies timid, wagging tongues all tied into knots, and in the palm of my hand glistened the end of a glorious rainbow.

Rather, we need to identify life's everyday mental obstacles - regret, fatigue, overconfidence, fear, to name just four - and put ourselves into position to hurdle them.” ― Gary Belsky, Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them: Lessons from the Life-Changing Science of Behavioral Economics"

"“To me, Hell isn’t a place; it’s a state of mind. It is a psychological self-imprisonment in which fear is the warden. It is a result of not living in alignment with your goals, dreams, and purpose. It is to find yourself in the endless emotional agony of, “What if?” ― Steve Maraboli"

That doesn’t mean you don’t wish them well, it just means that you are on Chapter ten of your life, when they are on Chapter five. Maybe, it is just enough to meet at the crossroads in life and agree to take separate paths, then with a cheshire grin you both look back and shout, “Beat you to the top of the mountain”, followed by the funnest sprint of both of your lives.” ― Shannon L. Alder"

"“MOTHER TIME: Life goes by so very fast, my dears, and taking the time to reflect, even once a year, slows things down. We zoom past so many seconds, minutes, hours, killing them with the frantic way we live that it's important we take at least this one collective sigh and stop, take stock, and acknowledge our place in time before diving back into the melee. Midnight on New Year's Eve is a unique kind of magic where, just for a moment, the past and the future exist at once in the present. Whether we're aware of it or not, as we countdown together to it, we're sharing the burden of our history and committing to the promise of tomorrow.” ― Hillary DePiano, New Year's Thieve"

"“MURRY: It's not that, it's just… I don't really get it. I usually find myself staring at the midnight deadline filled with regrets both for opportunities and loved ones missed. It's another day closer to the end. The last thing I feel like doing is counting down to some wild celebration. It just seems so sad to say goodbye to a year and know that it’s gone forever and you can’t go back to it. Not to relive, not to correct.NOEL: I've never thought about it that way.MURRY: There's something so final about it. It's the period at the end of the sentence.NOEL: The New Year's resolution.” ― Hillary DePiano, New Year's Thieve"
"“MURRY: Why do we even celebrate the New Year? It's just this arbitrary quirk of how we measure time in years, right? Midnight tonight is the very same transition from day to day that we do every 24 hours. But this thing in my hands, it feels real in a way the numbered calendar box never does. Why? What makes midnight tonight any different?” ― Hillary DePiano, New Year's Thieve"

"“Innovation and disruption are ideas that originated in the arena of business but which have since been applied to arenas whose values and goals are remote from the values and goals of business. People aren’t disk drives. Public schools, colleges and universities, churches, museums, and many hospitals, all of which have been subjected to disruptive innovation, have revenues and expenses and infrastructures, but they aren’t industries in the same way that manufacturers of hard-disk drives or truck engines or drygoods are industries. Journalism isn’t an industry in that sense, either.Doctors have obligations to their patients, teachers to their students, pastors to their congregations, curators to the public, and journalists to their readers--obligations that lie outside the realm of earnings, and are fundamentally different from the obligations that a business executive has to employees, partners, and investors. Historically, institutions like museums, hospitals, schools, and universities have been supported by patronage, donations made by individuals or funding from church or state. The press has generally supported itself by charging subscribers and selling advertising. (Underwriting by corporations and foundations is a funding source of more recent vintage.) Charging for admission, membership, subscriptions and, for some, earning profits are similarities these institutions have with businesses. Still, that doesn’t make them industries, which turn things into commodities and sell them for gain.” ― Jill Lepore"

"“What you need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as we've moved toward the dream. That's the point at which most people give up. It's the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.” ― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist"
"“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.” ― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist"

"“It will not always be easy, but it will always be beautiful.” ― Charlotte Eriksson"
"“Never mistake the uncomfortable feeling of insecurity and the fear of the unknown with the Holy Ghost’s promptings. Sometimes those feelings are simply Satan keeping you stuck where you are because he knows you will have a half-life there. He knows that you will spend half of your life disconnected, discontented and convincing your mind of what its heart will never accept. He knows when you have settled, gave up and didn’t try. Inaction is his greatest weapon, while regret is his second.” ― Shannon L. Alder"

"“I love coaching football, and winning a Super Bowl was a goal I’ve had for a long time. But it has never been my purpose in life. My purpose in life is simply to glorify God. We have to be careful that we don’t let the pursuit of our life’s goals, no matter how important they seem, cause us to lose sight of our purpose. I coach football. But the good I can do to glorify God along the way is my real purpose.” ― Tony Dungy"
"“On his thirteenth birthday he had seen a film in which the central character was a painter who, unable to sell his work, grew cold and hungry as he went from one unsuccessful interview to the next; eventually he had become a vagrant, sleeping in the streets of the city where once he had walked in hope. Hawksmoor left the cinema in a mood of profound, terrified apprehension and, from that time, he was filled with a sense of time passing and with the fear that he might be left discarded on its banks. The fear had not left him, although now he could no longer remember from where it came: he looked back on his earlier life without curiosity, since it seemed to lack intrinsic interest, and when he looked forward he saw the same steady attainment of goals without any joy in their attainment. For him, the state of happiness was simply the state of not suffering and, if he cared for anything, it was for oblivion.” ― Peter Ackroyd, Hawksmoor"

"“In essence, individuals more concerned with portraying their own uniqueness were more likely to select an alcoholic beverage not yet ordered at their table in an effort to demonstrate that they were in fact one of a kind. What these results show is that people are sometimes willing to sacrifice the pleasure they get from a particular consumption experience in order to project a certain image to others. When people order food and drinks, they seem to have two goals: to order what they will enjoy most and to portray themselves in a positive light in the eyes of their friends.” ― Dan Ariely, Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions"

"“We are all ghosts,"" Morris Klapper said at last. ""We are conceived in a moment of death and born out of ghost wombs, and we play in the streets with other little ghosts, chanting ghost-rhymes and scratching to become real. We are told that life is full of goals and that, although it is sadly necessary to fight, you can at least choose your war. But we learn that for ghosts there can only be one battle: to become real.
