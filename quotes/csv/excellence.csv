"“As Aristotle said, 'Excellence is a habit.' I would say furthermore that excellence is made constant through the feeling that comes right after one has completed a work which he himself finds undeniably awe-inspiring.

"“[All the ancient wisdom] tells us that work is necessary to us, as much a part of our condition as mortality; that good work is our salvation and our joy; that shoddy or dishonest or self-serving work is our curse and our doom. We have tried to escape the sweat and sorrow promised in Genesis - only to find that, in order to do so, we must forswear love and excellence, health and joy.(pg. 44, ""The Unsettling of America"")” ― Wendell Berry, The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays"
"“There were profound reasons for his attachment to the sea: he loved it because as a hardworking artist he needed rest, needed to escape from the demanding complexity of phenomena and lie hidden on the bosom of the simple and tremendous; because of a forbidden longing deep within him that ran quite contrary to his life's task and was for that very reason seductive, a longing for the unarticulated and immeasurable, for eternity, for nothingness. To rest in the arms of perfection is the desire of any man intent upon creating excellence; and is not nothingness a form of perfection?” ― Thomas Mann, Death in Venice and Other Tales"

"“Good human work honors God's work. Good work uses no thing without respect, both for what it is in itself and for its origin. It uses neither tool nor material that it does not respect and that it does not love. It honors nature as a great mystery and power, as an indispensable teacher, and as the inescapable judge of all work of human hands. It does not dissociate life and work, or pleasure and work, or love and work, or usefulness and beauty. To work without pleasure or affection, to make a product that is not both useful and beautiful, is to dishonor God, nature, the thing that is made, and whomever it is made for. This is blasphemy: to make shoddy work of the work of God. But such blasphemy is not possible when the entire Creation is understood as holy and when the works of God are understood as embodying and thus revealing His spirit. (pg. 312, Christianity and the Survival of Creation)” ― Wendell Berry, The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays"
"“I will never accept life for what it is. I don't need an easy life. My road was meant to be hard because anything worth having in this world will take me to the very edge of myself.

I am not ordinary and never was. I walk into my birthright as a queen with her head held high. I was born to do this!” ― Shannon L. Alder"

"“This was how mortals found fame, I thought. Through practice and diligence, tending their skills like gardens until they glowed beneath the sun. But gods are born of ichor and nectar, their excellences already bursting from their fingertips. So they find their fame by proving what they can mar: destroying cities, starting wars, breeding plagues and monsters. All that smoke and savor rising so delicately from our altars. It leaves only ash behind.” ― Madeline Miller, Circe"

I'm forced to learn, forced to smarten myself up, forced to wrestle. And if it works, then I'll have written something that is better than I am.” ― Shannon Hale"

"“To live a life of excellence, you will have to take risks. You will have to step into new territory and climb new mountains. If you’re up to something that’s as big as you are, it’s going to be scary. If it feels perfectly safe, you are probably underachieving.

"“A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between her work and her play; her labor and her leisure; her mind and her body; her education and her recreation. She hardly knows which is which. She simply pursues her vision of excellence through whatever she is doing, and leaves others to determine if she is working or playing. To herself, she always appears to be doing both.” ― Francois Rene De Chateaubriand"

"“Everything that we enjoy is a result of someone's hard work. Some work is visible and other work goes unseen, but both are equally important. Some people stop working as soon as they find a job. Regardless of the unemployment statistics, it is hard to find good people to work. Many people don't understand the difference between idle time and leisure time. Idle time amounts to wasting or stealing time; leisure time is earned. Procrastinating amounts to not working. Excellence is not luck; it is the result of a lot of hard work and practice.

"“The reason we all came to accept this dehumanizing system so wholeheartedly is because society made an implicit promise to its citizens in the Age of Standardization: if you can follow the straight path to its destination, you will be granted employment, social status, and financial security. ... According to the terms of this Standardization Covenant, society will bestow its rewards upon you as long as you abandon the individual pursuit of personal fulfillment for the standardized pursuit of professional excellence. ... The Standardization Covenant demands that we follow the Standard Formula to attain excellence, which will then lead to fulfillment—somehow. Dark horses, meanwhile, harness their individuality in the pursuit of fulfillment, which creates the optimal conditions for attaining excellence. ... The Standardization Covenant is holding all of us back. Though its views of talent and success are easy to grasp and reassuringly familiar, there is no future for a society devoted to the proposition that the pursuit of standardized excellence leads to fulfillment. The dark horse mindset, meanwhile, opens onto an unbounded social universe of achievement and joy. ... Every standardized institution, by definition and design, is focused on efficiency above all else, and generic motives and universal motives are efficient ways of moving the needle—on average, at least. But they’re horrible for your own fulfillment. Not only do standardized views of motivation ignore everything that is important about who you are, but by incessantly focusing all of our attention on a small set of institutionally ordained motives, the Standardization Covenant constrains our thinking about what a personal motive can even be. Fortunately, dark horses reveal the hidden truth about motivation ... Under the covenant, your chosen form of standardized excellence became your destination. Dark horses take a different perspective. When they consider excellence, they presume that individuality matters. ... The Standardization Covenant’s assurance that the pursuit of excellence leads to fulfillment was always a false promise. ... Only by prioritizing your own fulfillment can you advance toward your peak excellence, and only by advancing toward your peak excellence can you experience fulfillment. You need the energy of self-engineered passion and the direction of self-engineered purpose to scale the mountain of excellence, and you need the pride, self-worth, and sense of meaningful accomplishment from self-engineered achievement to experience the full flush of fulfillment. When you apply the four elements of the dark horse mindset in your own life, fulfillment and excellence come under your conscious control. You are no longer a puppet of fate, but the master of your destiny. When you focus on getting better at the things you care about most, you are not wandering. ... Now we have the chance to ratify a Dark Horse Covenant, predicated upon the belief that everyone possesses the potential for their own variety of merit and endorsing a core value of fulfillment, leading to a system of opportunity where anyone and everyone can succeed. This democratic meritocracy will be enforced by individuals, with the consent of individuals.” ― Todd Rose, Dark Horse: Achieving Success Through the Pursuit of Fulfillment"

"“Socially, he was awkward—shy, I suppose—and his writing at times was subpar; but an idea had presented itself to him, knocking at his brain like a nighttime traveler, and instead of shutting the door in its face, Browles built it a fire, he drew a chair for it up to the hearth and spent half a decade trying to decipher and then convey what it struggled to tell him. He was patient and industrious and quietly determined. Buffeted by setbacks and rejection and his own limitations, he persevered.” ― Julie Schumacher, Dear Commitee Members"
"“The great cricket Virat Kohli said in an interview that he does not try for excellence in cricket. Rather he tries to believe in a concept called 'betterment' - to become better each day than your former self. I believe there depth behind his words. The philosophy is simple yet profound . If you stay focussed in any field, then you would eventually become adept in your skills in that field. By consistently doing your work better each day, you would go closer to achieving your best or excellence.

"“Only as a young man playing pool all night for money had he been able to find what he wanted in life, and then only briefly. People thought pool hustling was corrupt and sleazy, worse than boxing. But to win at pool, to be a professional at it, you had to deliver. In a business you could pretend that skill and determination had brought you along, when it had only been luck and muddle. A pool hustler did not have the freedom to believe that. There were well-paid incompetents everywhere living rich lives. They arrogated to themselves the plush hotel suites and Lear Jets that America provided for the guileful and lucky far more than it did for the wise. You could fake and bluff and luck your way into all of it. Hotel suites overlooking Caribbean private beaches. Bl*wj*bs from women of stunning beauty. Restaurant meals that it took four tuxedoed waiters to serve, with the sauces just right. The lamb or duck in tureen sliced with precise and elegant thinness, sitting just so on the plate, the plate facing you just so on the heavy white linen, the silver fork heavy gleaming in your manicured hand below the broad cloth cuff and mother of pearl buttons. You could get that from luck and deceit even while causing the business or the army or the government that supported you to do poorly at what it did. The world and all its enterprises could slide downhill through stupidity and bad faith. But the long gray limousines would still hum through the streets of New York, of Paris, of Moscow, of Tokyo. Though the men who sat against the soft leather in back with their glasses of 12-year-old scotch might be incapable of anything more than looking important, of wearing the clothes and the hair cuts and the gestures that the world, whether it liked to or not, paid for, and always had paid for.Eddie would lie in bed sometimes at night and think these things in anger, knowing that beneath the anger envy lay like a swamp. A pool hustler had to do what he claimed to be able to do. The risks he took were not underwritten. His skill on the arena of green cloth, cloth that was itself the color of money, could never be only pretense. Pool players were often cheats and liars, petty men whose lives were filled with pretensions, who ran out on their women and walked away from their debts. But on the table with the lights overhead beneath the cigarette smoke and the silent crowd around them in whatever dive of a billiard parlor at four in the morning, they had to find the wherewithal inside themselves to do more than promise excellence. Under whatever lies might fill the life, the excellence had to be there, it had to be delivered. It could not be faked. But Eddie did not make his living that way anymore.” ― Walter Tevis, The Color of Money"

"“The death of quality foreshadows the death of humanity. What is the point of humanity if it does not produce the highest quality and excellence? A humanity that is not ascending is descending. As it is, the crushing weight of averageness and mediocrity presses down on everything and makes all high things flat, drab and dull. All the tall poppies have to die.

"“In Greece, there was no dominating church or creed, but there was a dominating ideal, which everyone would want to pursue if he caught sight of it. Different men saw it differently. It was one thing to the artist, another to the warrior. Excellence is the nearest equivalent we have for the word they used for it, but it meant more than that. It was the utmost perfection possible; the very best and highest a man could attain to which when perceived always has a compelling authority. A man must strive to attain it. We must love the highest when we see it. No one Socrates said is willingly deprived of the Good. To win it required all that a man could give.” ― Edith Hamilton, The Greek Way"

"“The greatest enemy of enlightenment is “common sense”. In day-today life, common sense “works”, which is why ordinary people revere it. Most managers in the workplace are good at common sense i.e. knowing how to play the system, to obey the rules, to pander to higher managers, to avoid radical ideas, to highlight their modest successes and blame others for their failures, and to stick firmly within the domain of the conventional, acceptable and uncontroversial. Unfortunately, they’re hopeless at everything else. All geniuses, on the other hand, can “see” far beyond the realm of common sense. They use imagination, intuition and visionary ideas as their guides, not the trivialities of common sense. What would you rather be – a middle manager with a comfortable common sense life, or a genius who has unlocked the door to the mysteries of existence? Tragically for humanity, most people aspire to be middle managers. That’s the extent of their ambition, that’s as far as their horizons stretch.

The opening image is when we’re eighteen, say, and our closing image is when we’re about fifty. We all have thirty-two years to get our closing image right, and hardly anyone succeeds. When we’re on our deathbed, will we be proud of our closing image, or tormented by it? That’s the challenge of the movie of our life. That’s when we know if we’re going to heaven or hell. That’s the Final Judgment.” ― Mike Hockney, The Last Bling King"
"“Greg realised these weren’t his closing images at all. They were the opening images of the new movie of his life, the movie he’d be happy to watch on an infinite loop.

This is the mindset of the truly excellent person.” ― Brian Tracy"

"“The search for better, for more competent men, from the presidents of our great companies down to our household servants, was never more vigorous than it is now. And more than ever before is the demand for competent men in excess of the supply.What we are all looking for, however, is the readymade, competent man; the man whom some one else has trained. It is only when we fully realize that our duty, as well as our opportunity, lies in systematically cooperating to train and to make this competent man, instead of in hunting for a man whom some one else has trained, that we shall be on the road to national efficiency.In the past the prevailing idea has been well expressed in the saying that “Captains of industry are born, not made”; and the theory has been that if one could get the right man, methods could be safely left to him. In the future it will be appreciated that our leaders must be trained right as well as born right, and that no great man can (with the old system of personal management) hope to compete with a number of ordinary men who have been properly organized so as efficiently to cooperate.In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first. This in no sense, however, implies that great men are not needed. On the contrary, the first object of any good system must be that of developing first-class men; and under systematic management the best man rises to the top more certainly and more rapidly than ever before.” ― Frederick Winslow Taylor, The Principles of Scientific Management"

"“When I was a young girl, I studied Greek in school. It's a beautiful language and ever so many good things were written in it. When you speak Greek, it feels like a little bird flapping its wings on your tongue as fast as it can. This is why I sometimes put Greek words into my stories, even though not so many people speak Ancient Greek anymore. Anything beautiful deserves to be shared round, and anything I love goes into my stories for safekeeping.The word I love is Arete. It has a simple meaning and a complicated meaning. The simple one is: excellence. But if that were all, we'd just use Excellence and I wouldn't bring it up until we got to E. Arete means your own excellence. Your very own. A personal excellence that belongs to no one else, one that comes out of all the things that make you special and different. Arete means whatever you are best at, no matter what that is. You might think the Greeks only meant things like fighting with bronze swords or debating philosophy, but they didn't. They meant whatever you're best at. What makes you feel like you're doing the rightest thing in the world. And that might be fighting with bronze swords and it might mean debating philosophy—but it also might mean building machines, or drawing pictures, or playing the guitar, or acting in Shakespeare plays, or writing books, or making a home for people who need one, or listening so hard and so well that people tell you the things they really need to say even if they didn't mean to, or running faster than anyone else, or teaching people patiently and boldly, or even making pillow forts or marching in parades or baking bread. It could be lending out just the right library book to just the right person at just the right moment. It could be standing up to the powerful even if you don't feel very powerful yourself, even if you're lost and as far away from home as you can get. It could be loving someone with the same care and thoroughness that a Wyvern takes with alphabetizing. It could be anything in the world. And it isn't easy to figure out what that is. It's even harder to get that good at it, because nothing, not even being yourself, comes without practice. But your arete goes with you everywhere, just waiting for you to pay attention to it. You can't lose it. You can only find it. And that's my favorite thing that starts with A.” ― Catherynne M. Valente, The Girl Who Fell Beneath Fairyland and Led the Revels There"
"“He loved the sea for deep-seated reasons: the hardworking artist's need for repose, the desire to take shelter from the demanding diversity of phenomena in the bosom of boundless simplicity, a propensity—proscribed and diametrically opposed to his mission in life and for that very reason seductive—a propensity for the unarticulated, the immoderate, the eternal, for nothingness. To repose in perfection is the desire of all those who strive for excellence, and is not nothingness a form of perfection?” ― Thomas Mann, Death in Venice"

To create an extraordinary life you will have to be present in each moment and give 100 percent of yourself. You will have to commit each day to being the best you can be, and aspire to perform your daily tasks in the most conscious way possible. Living your best year requires you to take a moment each time you’re about to make a move—whether you are about to deliver a communication, make a decision, or put something into your body—and make sure that move reflects the very highest choice you could make. ” ― Debbie Ford, The Best Year of Your Life: Dream It, Plan It, Live It"

If they don't turn out, keep at it. Take more shots and be persistent. Focus on making success clearly happen. Use perseverance.” ― Mark LaMoure"

"“You are the author of your success, daily writing a new page to the book of your life. Everyday you live, you write another page of success for your life. Practice at becoming an excellent person step-by-step, at what you want.

"“There is no limit to life. The only limit is the limit you put into life.” ― Lailah Gifty Akita, Think Great: Be Great!"
"“You are all too rich to be happy, child. For must not each of you be the constitutions of your family marry to be still richer? People who know in what their main excellence consists are not to be blamed (are they?) for cultivating and improving what they think most valuable? Is true happiness any part of your family-view?—So far from it, that none of your family but yourself could be happy were they not rich. So let them fret on, grumble and grudge, and accumulate; and wondering what ails them that they have not happiness when they have riches, think the cause is want of more; and so go on heaping up till Death, as greedy an accumulator as themselves, gathers them into his garner!” ― Samuel Richardson, Clarissa, or, The History of a Young Lady"
"“Leaders motivate people to understand that they can do better than they’ve already done and go farther than they’ve reached.” ― Israelmore Ayivor, Leaders' Ladder"
"“Excellence is a journey and a constant process. It is never a final destination. Have fun and enjoy it as a lifetime self-improvement program. Polish yourself for excellence. Glitter and sparkle for success.” ― Mark F. LaMoure"
"“Now is your time. Make excellence your goal. Let success be your destiny.” ― Mark F. LaMoure"
"“A leadership comfort zone brings stagnancy, deprives one of innovation, stifles growth and frustrates both the leader and the team they lead. Your personal preferences like leadership style, communication style, prejudices, habits and mannerisms must be effectively managed so that they do not work against you. You have to be careful that your strengths do not end up becoming a hindering comfort zone. Seek to lead, driven by a cause.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Something good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!” ― Mehmet Murat ildan"

"“Don't wait for a huge platform before you give of your best performance” ― Bernard Kelvin Clive"
"“What you do defines who your are. Remember to be the best at what you do. You develop higher confidence from doing what you do excellently.” ― Mark F. LaMoure"
"“Aim high to achieve excellence. Be determined to succeed. Use self-discipline to achieve golden excellence.” ― Mark F. LaMoure"
"“It is the challenge for every leader to develop and invest in those he depends on, to ensure his or her vision is realized in the way it has been put upon the leader’s heart. These key people will enhance the success or taint the leadership image and brand of the visionary.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You choose the leaders and place them strategically around the table of your vision and mission. They are already around you because of some degree of loyalty, so if you continue putting 80% effort in enhancing loyalty that already exists, you will end up going into overkill and igniting a toxic level of internal office politics that was not originally existent in your organisation.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The African Challenge - We must end conflict in Africa. We must lead to allow the Africans to enjoy the benefits from their natural resources. We must end poverty in Africa. Every African must be educated, have access to health care and a fair chance to fulfil their dream. Preventable sickness and disease must not reduce life expectancy or rob pregnant women of a chance to continue living. Africa must develop. Africa must not depend on foreign aid. Africa must be united and governed more effectively. Africa must customize her leadership culture and philosophy in a way that gives her global relevance and respect but still remain true and authentic to herself. Will you accept the challenge? Will you be that Africa?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If in this generation, you still consider yourself the only one who knows or who has the capacity to make a difference, it’s a shame because you are delaying this leadership excellence train from reaching its destination. Make a decision to change your leadership philosophy and agenda today!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Every leader must be challenged to educate their followers and capacitate them with knowledge, tools and a voice to champion their own causes and become actively involved in setting the agenda for citizen participation in social transformation. Don’t create a dependent constituency; develop and lead other leaders who demonstrate a growing personal responsibility for their own success as well as for those around them.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The lack of knowledge on the part of followers perpetuates a culture of abuse by bad leadership. Every day, issues are being endorsed in the name of standing for the ignorant masses, only to benefit those who sponsor the agendas. Priorities are set and resources allocated, never to benefit or reach those cited as the underlying justification for sourcing the funds or setting the priorities.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Around the world, the perception and reality of corruption and bad governance in public places remains very high. But it isn’t just in governments that these are found; they can permeate through society, where they are rampant in private enterprises and even religious institutions. We need to deal with the causes, not just consequences. You will need to play your role, both as a good example as well as part of the social police force. Cultures and beliefs must change at a personal level as well as at institutional levels.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Just imagine the strides Africa would have made if all the resources being channeled towards conflict resolution were going into construction of power generation plants and irrigation capacity. Can’t we promote our own peace? What are we doing to seriously focus on other eco-friendly energy sources like wind and solar?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Development of states, urbanization, mechanization and industrialisation have all brought phenomenal strides to growth and prosperity of economies and their populace. They have also brought with them the insatiable need for energy resources with the related offspring of instability, conflict, war and corruption.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"

"“Our people must once again realize that it is only hard work and excellence that leads to wealth creation.” ― Sunday Adelaja"
"“Imagine yourself doing what is best for you. Commit yourself to excellence. Transform yourself with dedication to excellence, from daily self-improvement and practice. Enjoy the process.” ― Mark F. LaMoure"
"“Becoming excellent at want, helps raises your confidence and develops your courage. Most of all, it can give you a grand reputation.” ― Mark F. LaMoure"
"“One of the greatest tools you cannot do without is the media. These various means for mass communication and those involved in them must be your partners and not your enemies; you must not be afraid of them but befriend and love them. If you are going to be significant and relevant then you are going to need someone to help broadcast your voice and channel your substance to the world.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“No matter how great you are at what you do, as long as you remain known only within your own family circles, then you and your talent will die in obscurity and irrelevance. Position yourself to influence the masses by having a media, marketing and communication strategy.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The key questions and challenges that we must all continue to pose and remind this key sector (the media) should be, 'Do you realize the power you have, to build and to destroy; to promote success or failure; to bring life or death to a cause or talent; to give a platform or take it away?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Work is simply, “force x distance” or the product of a force applied to an object and the displacement of the object in the direction of the applied force…holding an object in the air does not involve any work, no matter how painful your hand will be after a few minutes… reflect on your daily activities and the results from them. Are you really working or just increasing your potential without progress or desired results? Your work must produce some movement, progress and change, by effectively using all your energies whether intellectual or physical.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Creating the right mind-set and a positive attitude today, will help you to start crafting a clear plan of how you intend to make your life a success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Realise your Stewardship role as a parent – you raise children to offer a quality gift to society. Even your spouse should not be treated as an object or possession you own; support them to be the best of what they were created to be. Do your part and trust God for the rest. If you have empowered them, trust them to be responsible.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There is need to focus on selling an emotional experience instead of a mere product or service - the impression you make on others must be lasting and permanent. These experiences have to be positive and worth remembering. This will increase the chances of repeat business and referrals, guaranteeing customer loyalty. And that is what sustains businesses, brands and careers for generations! The principle remains the same for comedians, actors, footballers, musicians, sales executives or any other area of specialty.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You cannot offer quality experiences as an isolated island. Learn to work well with others on the success train. Respect those you work with and appreciate their contribution in making you the best at what you do.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your life is connected to other key support structures that you must never neglect, including family, fans, supporters, affiliations, professional associations, religious membership and others. Your membership to such groupings must add value to others whilst you equally get the benefit they are supposed to provide their members.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Tactical use of the media can be equated to power behind your skill or special ability. It is in the power of the media to help market your brand. You just need to look at Hollywood, European football, Bollywood, Nollywood, Global fashion & modeling, showbiz and even humanitarian efforts, to appreciate that the making and destroying of stars, initiatives and legends is to a greater extent influenced by the role played by the media.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If the African stars do not rise, are not known, remain obscure, their stories are not told – who and where is the African story teller? Your challenge if you are in the media is to continually ask if you are doing enough, using the appropriate strategies and at the right platforms. Let’s create and promote international and global stars with the talent and skills in our people, no one will do it for us.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Leadership success means your mission and vision must outlive you, but this will not happen by accident. We have enough stories around us to prove that lasting legacies have to be well managed, planned and structured for continuity. If not, you will carry your name, success and influence to the grave, only leaving short-lived memories of your achievements and impact.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Change in leadership brands must be influenced and proactively effected at a personal level, it can never be forced from outside with sustainable effectiveness. Saddam Hussein, Muammar al Gaddafi and Hosni Mubarak are all political trophies, yet the effects of the military or “civil” initiatives that toppled them, are nothing to be proud of considering what continues to happen in countries like Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria, after the use of force to bring political change.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There are batons that you will obviously choose to pass on, upon your death, but there are others that would be advisable you pass on whilst you are still alive. Implement as practicable as possible, all succession elements that can be done whilst you are still alive so that you can ensure they are done according to your will/desire.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Timing is a critical issue when it comes to succession. Passing the baton too early or too late could both cause irreparable damage. The timing just has to be right, but again you are responsible for creating or influencing the right conditions over the course of your leadership tenure.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Having a succession and legacy plan in place will make you ready for forced changes due to circumstances beyond your control, like death, any form of incapacity, sudden changes in laws and regulations and even corporate scandals and moral failure.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Passing the baton - Oh what a challenge this has proven to be in many societies, families, businesses, governments, religious organizations and obviously in every other relay race! Why do this? - for starters, you will not live forever – how about that? After a given mileage, even a car will need new tyres!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Start planning from your internal or spiritual view of things. The external view always has a way of distorting, discouraging and limiting your dream.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“When you have pictured and defined your desired legacy, allow your present life activities and efforts to begin reflecting the future you desire. Begin to do what you want to see, become involved in the causes you want to be a part of. Show your legatees how you want and expect things to be done after you are gone. This will enable them to fit the vision into their own as they make their own individual unique mark.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“A leader, who divides his own people, contaminates his platform and begins to destroy his own territory.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Consider your will to be the vision of your influence on earth after you cease to be a part of it. Crafting a lasting legacy means you start planning and making it possible now.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Release children as part of your delegated leadership influence - this will enable you to leave a legacy worth noting. Realise the risk in delegation and bestowing this trust - if you sacrifice a rib, you expose your heart to possible pain, hurt or pride, fulfilment and joy. When these come – it’s not the end of the world, be brave enough to face the challenge with a positive attitude.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Do not do everything for your children – teach them personal responsibility and accountability. This includes using your home environment – the kitchen, the garden, making their room/bed, chores – as training platforms. Prepare them to be independent.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Open the door for communication and interact with your children. Provide the answers (if you don’t know, look for them or get expert advice). Guide them on how to deal with other sources of information – friends, TV, other media, society or the internet. Coaching empowers them to make their own informed, quality decisions.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Empower your children - Allow self-discovery and self-awareness (their own key to success), Facilitate an environment for learning through experience (practice of knowledge acquired). Remember, this exploration will take place whether you approve or not – it’s inevitable, that’s why YOU MUST be in charge of providing awareness and exposure to improve the quality of decisions made during exploration and experimentation.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Teach faith as a non-negotiable - What should your family be aware of? Why should they be aware of these things? How will they become aware? When and at what stages must they become aware?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“It’s about teamwork, realizing we are on the same side and complementing each other. The family is at its best when exposed to and engaged in high-quality environments, interactions, and relationships. This is not technological or economic quality – it is leadership and effectiveness quality. Children mature best when the adults in their life work in partnership with one another. There must exist important aligning of mission, beliefs, values and behaviours within the family unit.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“A leader must produce other leaders. Why do you want to produce followers, when by being called a leader the assumption is that you already have followers? Influence those who follow to birth their kind and develop others to lead.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Begin to invest in productive capacity, and the ability to see people flying or shining on the platform you have set for them in support of your vision. You need to draw the best out of them so that the reach and impact of your vision becomes phenomenal. See them as your extension, the multiplication of the tentacles of your vision and mission – sometimes when they shine, they are not trying to replace you at all, they are trying to be a “little you” somewhere you cannot be, as you focus on other key strategic issues elsewhere.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Alignment of vision, mission, values and attitudes need to be matched between you and those you choose to surround yourself with. The cost of training or replacing will be very minimal and less painful if recruitment, selection and positioning are done well. This applies even to general employment processes, whether at leadership or staff levels.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Everyone is a business person. You must be in the business of managing your time. Managing your time means managing your life. Good time managers are good life managers, and vice versa.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Serious businesses and lenders will tell you that managing your cash flow is one of the most important aspects in the health of any business. Managing you time flow is key to a healthy and successful life, because, Time is equal to Life. The quality of time expenditure is in direct proportion to the quality of life enjoyed.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You are only as authentic as the substance you have inside you. Having others take your examinations or doing your assignments and projects is to reduce the level of authenticity of your qualification as well as your personal brand. Master your chosen area of study to the highest level and demonstrate that you have full knowledge as a specialist. Let the depth of your knowledge make you sought after and respected. Define yourself and be authentic.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your life as an effective person must always have productivity surrounding all your efforts, there must be a sustained forward and upward trajectory in every area of your life. This is where the Shona Shereketa meets the Japanese Kaizen - you are moving and shaking past mediocrity on the basis of small but continuous improvements that will ultimately result in positive quality changes to your life.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Make sure your reading, studying or research are always adding value to the defined vision, mission, beliefs and values that form your unique personal brand.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your growth and involvement must begin to show lasting footprints as you exude maximum effectiveness and significance. Your leadership influence must translate into a source of inspiration for your peers and those who look at you as a leader.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The question is what kind of stuff do you immerse your mind in? What kind of food does your brain feed on? What kind of exercise does it get and for what purpose? What do you spend time listening to? What thoughts do you entertain? All these are the processes that form the conveyor belt into your subconscious mind.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“To succeed and create change, you must be willing to take the risk, with an understanding of a number of key elements. Please begin to understand that an entrepreneurial spirit is not only essential in business enterprise. We all have a business to run in our different areas of specialty. Your life is your business and your family is your business – you have multiple businesses.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“An entrepreneurial spirit makes you someone who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business enterprise, talent or calling to become an agent of change.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Entrepreneurship is the process of discovering new ways of combining resources to create change – in whatever area of life.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Money might be a reward (by-product) but should not always be the only goal of your efforts and enterprise.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Dreams are difficult to measure if they remain wishes – crystallise them into measurable goals with specific targets and action plans. Goals/objectives are easier to measure when broken down into tasks with clear targets and deadlines.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Choices and decisions must be supported by your passion, resolve and a productive work ethic. If these meet opportunity - your success has finally come!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Without clarity and motivation, your vision will remain a wish in dream-land… It takes an action-centred and results-driven work ethic to execute your duties and responsibilities, to make your success more deliberate.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“A mission without action is equally ineffective and futile as action without mission. Use the “power of precision,” and remember language shapes thought and thought shapes action.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Some people choose to lead, others to follow. Success is not primarily a matter of circumstances or native talent or even intelligence — it is a choice. Your beliefs, passion, values, enthusiasm, relationships, interpersonal skills and how they are blended, will move you further ahead towards success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“So why don’t we take the step of setting goals for ourselves? One reason that stands out is that we aren’t willing to accept full responsibility for our lives. If we don’t set goals, then we don’t have to reach them. Another excuse is that goal setting has never been part of our lives or culture. As a result, we may end up mixing with people who have no clear idea where they are headed, becoming a person who “follows the followers.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The reward for goal-setting is that as you achieve each goal, you feel in charge of your own destiny, with every moment taken up productively. Self-esteem increases and it becomes easier to remain motivated. So set those high goals and make clear plans for their execution.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Stop judging yourself on the basis of your appearance or condition of present circumstances. You may have an old car, in debt, job stress, and a troubled relationship, but they are not a true reflection of you as long as you are working on the vision of what you will be years from now.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Concentrate on your strengths and talents to change your situation, and avoid those pity-parties. Absorbing the blows and present pain is a quality of greatness. Measure yourself against the goals and standards you have set for yourself, rather than comparing yourself to others and feeling discouraged or useless.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your age reflects or measures the rate at which you have been spending life. Every one born into this world is given life and that life is measured in units of time. Spending time means spending life, wasting time means wasting life. Getting value out of time means, getting value out of life. Time does not stop moving because we stopped working with purpose, meaning life does not stop or take a break even when you plan to go on vacation. You never stop spending time, even when you don’t have a penny in your pocket.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The question is, do you have deliberate plans for your life? Do you have intentions with you time? God planned that there should be a time for everything and for every season, meaning you can plan for everything and every season in your life! You may ask, 'Is that possible?” I say, “It’s up to you!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You make the plans - otherwise you will die thinking it is not possible to plan to have time for work, for exercise, for sleep, for relaxation, for recreation, for eating, for entertainment, for love, for family, for spirituality, for friends, for personal reflection, for personal development, for business, for charity all in one life!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There must be a season for everything that measures what success means to you, there must be a deliberately scheduled time slot for the things that are important to you. Wishing is not enough, deliberate plans followed by deliberate actions make it possible.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Not planning for your time expenditure simply means deliberately intending to fail.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Consistently turning up for meetings late, is a statement saying you have no respect for the person you are meeting or for the purpose of the meeting, or both. You are sending a clear message that this person or the reason for your meeting is not important to you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Everything you love, enjoy, respect or value will somehow find top priority, even without excessive conscious reminders. Show respect through the way you manage time, especially when others are involved or affected.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“It must start by knowing Time = Life. Spending your life on impulse will lead to a broke life, just like impulse buying leads to an empty wallet! How much value you place on your time reflects in the activities that consume your time.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your new challenge is to redesign your time allocations. Your strategic focus determines where your time resources will be mainly invested. Prioritise acting out your own script, make your own movie instead of spending too much time watching others at work through the TV. It is surprising the number of unsuccessful people who spend all their time resources on the social media platforms following the lives of the successful. Make the news, be the leader and let others follow you. Align you priorities and balance your activities.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The setting of SMART goals has been written about extensively over the decades, but will only be as useful as the extent to which its principles are used.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Review and question what you already know or have. In most ball sports and games, you confirm whether you have scored by checking whether the ball has gone into the goal or hit its target. So evaluation of results means that you must look at your goal to see if the ball has hit its target. Look at your educational aspirations or dreams and say “am I on track to meet my 2020 PhD target?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Make adjustments and improvements to enhance the effectiveness of meetings or surpassing of your target. Learn to define, quantify and be specific about what, how and when you want to succeed in each area of your life.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Shereketa” is a Shona word ordinarily meaning to fidget, to be restless, and to show discomfort. Whilst this word has largely been used negatively, the Shereketa principle channels it into a different dimension to be used positively for success. Shereketa re–defined refers to deliberate movements, actions and adjustments inspired by the calling to excellence & success, driven by a conviction against and a growing discomfort with mediocrity. The movements and actions take place in two realms - the inner spirit/convictions of your heart and the outer execution platforms of your physical and material world (Shereketa within and Shereketa without).” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Deliberately and purposefully schedule meetings with yourself. These are the most important meetings in the life of one who intends to make their success deliberate. During these meeting you do much of the quality and honest communication with yourself. This is besides the conversations you are always carrying on with yourself in your own head or audibly. That doesn’t mean you are crazy, we all do it and we just need to improve the quality and positivity of those conversations.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Be disciplined enough to choose your network and be willing to sacrifice the circles that reduce your effectiveness and make you unproductive.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You are in obscurity when you are still needed but no one cares a lot what you say or think, or even where you are working from. You have no voice or presence that makes you relevant. Grow your voice.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The biblical preacher talks about the poor man’s wisdom that saved a city but he was immediately forgotten. A poverty of ideas, contributions, uniqueness or influence, will overshadow the visibility of good potential. Keep those ideas flowing and you will not be forgotten.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Some people are known, they have the platform and presence, but still remain irrelevant. They know you and what you do, but they don’t need you or your offering. I see too many people with a platform but without substance, again this is not sustainable. Lack of substance can only relegate your talent or skill towards the league of the mediocre, if at all you become much by superficial branding then you will become the best of the worst. You don't have what it takes but you depend on your ability to sell substandard offerings to the market. It will not last for long, but quickly become irrelevant.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Understand that every ‘voice’ has the spirit to influence. Watch your tone, accent, volume and speed. Be careful that you don’t sound angry or argumentative whenever driving an important point. Equally important, is not sounding serious or sounding playful when the message being conveyed needs to be taken seriously.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The obvious signs of a brand gone wrong are the levels of negative headlines it consistently attracts. People talking about you for all the negative and wrong reasons. You begin to shoot yourself in the foot and you have become your own enemy. The gospel about you should be good enough to create relevance and significance - or rather to confirm that.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You must learn to accept that humans make mistakes, but when the same issue is repeated over and over without corrective strategies to plug the holes, then you must expect negative impact on your definition of success. It is normal to make a mistake, but learn, face the consequences, get back up and march on. If you want to be different or stand out as a brand, then your actions, habits, behaviours and decisions must reflect that 'you care about what people think or say about you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you are going to grow in personal effectiveness, you must become an excellent communicator. Achieving your goals and fulfilling your mission calls for communication excellence verbally, vocally and non-verbally. As you grow in this regard, you make forward strides towards significance – the capacity to make contributions that count and matter.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“People and organisations should want to be associated with you as a brand. A sign of a depleted and irrelevant brand is unwillingness of your market or peers to associate with you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you can listen to yourself and obey yourself more, then you have increased your chances for attaining personal effectiveness.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Why do people seek one and not the other? It is the majorities that are led and they normally follow those who can help them meet their ever-present and growing needs. Question is, do you possess the kind of solutions they want? Are you well positioned to reach them or to be reachable by those who can benefit from your solution to their challenges?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“To achieve your desired success you have to be effectively selling something and to be significant in impact, you must be teaching somehow. How effectively are you selling and how well are you teaching?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The world is always throwing challenges and questions - which ones does your mission and purpose respond to or seek to solve? Do you know your mission and have you clearly defined the life-issues you intend to address?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Selling and teaching demand that you develop your intrapersonal and interpersonal communication skills. You must be able to communicate with yourself as well as with others in a way that makes them buy your offering or benefit from the knowledge you want to impart.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“So many voices are out there, both excellent and mediocre, do you have a credible solution for the needs of your target market or audience? … prove the authenticity of your substance. Do you have what it takes to make a difference? Whilst some come as talents, their development to excellence and maturity will not come without passion, resolve, productive work ethic and opportunity.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Who are you’ is a question of both substance and position. In other words, what is the authority of your voice, service, product or performance in relation to the needs of those you intend to serve? Secondly, have you defined and demystified yourself enough to be accepted as the solution of choice?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Have you positioned yourself to be reachable and accessible by those you seek to serve and make an impact on? Do they know where and how to find you, either physically or in the cyber realm? If they cannot reach you for whatever reason, then you have not done your homework, because you are supposed to have a strategy to reach them before they can even look for you! Otherwise someone else will meet them along the way as they look for you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Sometimes you may feel like your life is submerged in life's relentless challenges, but you can develop the kind of internal substance in you that displaces every negativity, fear and self-doubt. Even if the challenges were bigger and heavy on your soul and life, the new attitude and belief within will displace every challenge before you - then the law of buoyancy will begin to force your challenges to be ejected out of your pathway to success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“At times the challenges will displace us or some of the things that are important to us. If we strengthen our belief system from within – those challenges must inevitably begin to float away and not take root or force us to sink.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Make a deliberate effort to feed your conscious and subconscious mind to achieve a well programmed mind frame, ready to succeed. Read the right material, watch the right material and listen to the right material. Practice and expose yourself to the right material so that you can form positive attitudes, positive feelings and positive habits. For each person, the right material is defined from their unique vision, mission, beliefs and values.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You feed the requisite substance through personal development efforts and position yourself strategically to allow the forces around you to create the path for your relevance and significance. You are not lifted by air, but by the substance inside you hitting the springboard of opportunity.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Making success deliberate means that you must make success a habit; and habits are a product of the subconscious mind. We call them habits because we can actually do them without being conscious of what we are doing. Things we end up doing without sitting down to think because we have done them so many times, thought about them so many times they are now imprinted onto our subconscious mind. If we could think about success so much, practice it so much more, then we imprint thoughts and seeds of success onto our subconscious that it becomes a habit.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Even if you bury me underground and put a concrete slab over the hole – one day you will wake up to find a crack in the concrete with a tiny green sprout shooting through. When you see that shoot – that will be me!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Skills and special abilities will only grow if you practice more. You become a star-performer by doing. Let performance and production of desired results become a consistent habit associated with your personal brand.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“After you acquire knowledge and skill, aim to be a practitioner. Time for practice on the job or in life will still test your authenticity. Knowledge is one of the greatest sources of confidence, and you will need that confidence to do your work and demonstrate you know what you have been trained for.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You cannot bury someone with the Shereketa spirit for long. Even if they are thrown into problems, they will rise back up.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“In reality, while we aim for excellence, we're always living on somebody's dunghill.” ― Jo Walton, The Philosopher Kings"
"“If life gives you a passport size dream, don't frame it... Order for a reprint... Go for the bigger picture of you! You deserve a bigger and bright image of you... Go and soar like an eagle!” ― Israelmore Ayivor, Daily Drive 365"
"“Your inability to do what you are noted for doing is a critical step to wading off your past glories of excellence!” ― Israelmore Ayivor, Daily Drive 365"
"“Blossoming out through one's comfort zone should be well meaning so as to achieve newer levels of excellence” ― Priyavrat Thareja"
"“All you need is a little hope in order cope in times of failure, and be able to try again with a better intelligence for excellence!” ― Israelmore Ayivor, Daily Drive 365"
"“Procrastination causes pressure that zaps creativity and excellence.” ― Todd Stocker, Becoming The Fulfilled Leader"
"“If you want to achieve excellence, you can get there today. As of this second, quit doing less-than-excellent work.” ― Thomas Watson"
"“Excellence is a way of life.” ― Bohdi Sanders, Modern Bushido: Living a Life of Excellence"
"“Making a decision to live a life of excellence, and living a life of excellence are two difference things.” ― Bohdi Sanders, Modern Bushido: Living a Life of Excellence"
"“Learn from mistakes and set-backs (yours and other people’s), pick yourself up, make necessary changes and try again. I once came across a saying that went something like, “The wise learn from the mistakes made by fools!” So at some point we all have been fools, I suppose, since we all make mistakes.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Study to acquire knowledge - not just to get a certificate or promotion. Acquisition of knowledge is key to the programming or reprogramming of your mind and expanding your frame of reference. Choose the areas of study in line with your vision and mission as well as your strengths and interests. Make sure you seek opportunities to practice and implement the new information and knowledge you gain from your study.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The results you are churning out are a direct or indirect reflection of what you allowed into your life. Unlearning what you already know and practice is no easy task, but sometimes it’s necessary for the programming or re-programming that must take place for success to be made deliberate.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you really want to get good at anything, you've got to work at it for ten thousand hours.” ― Mark Batterson, A Trip around the Sun: Turning Your Everyday Life into the Adventure of a Lifetime"
"“People may forget the quantity of your works but cannot forget the quality of your works.” ― Ifeanyi Enoch Onuoha"
"“Excellence will give you the recognition you crave for, but humility will keep you standing longer than expected.” ― Rebecca Edmund"
"“Excellence is not a skill. It is an attitude.” ― Ralph Marston"
"“Seek to develop your skill and talent to a level of relevance. Create a platform to shine and make sure you are bringing a difference to the areas that require your expertise. A pastor who does not teach or pray for people, a football player always playing pool, a body builder who doesn’t eat but sleeps all day, a student who studies only towards examinations, a politician without a cause and a business without a customer service culture all have one thing in common – sooner or later they will all become irrelevant. Never miss the chance to practice the call of your mission, even if you are not getting paid for it.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Every effective person must be able to sell and teach, whether in private or to a group in public. This applies equally to skills and talents as it does to products and services.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Always remember that every word you say contains power and you must ask yourself a few questions about your words; Are these words true and kind? Are these words relevant and necessary? Are these words effective for intentions? Reflect on what your words carry, they are a life-changing container!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Be stimulated to become significant. This might be your back-slap moment. New-born babies born with weak signs of life are given a slap on the back to “stimulate” them. It is a knock to wake them up to the reality that they must now take charge. In this world, they have to do their own breathing and their own eating otherwise they will not survive. It’s the same in your adulthood and your quest for success, you must take charge because no one will wake up every day to do things for you and make a success out of a life of excuses and laziness.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Positioning yourself and effective branding should not be left to sports and movie stars. Your need a personal coach, manager or mentor otherwise your expertise, skills or talent will not go far. You might have what it takes but sometimes you lack strategy and some finer elements.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your personal development is your personal responsibility. No one can study or acquire knowledge for you. There are things only you can do, to bring the change or the results you require to make progress in life.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you want to excel in any endeavour you must pay attention to detail, know exactly what you want, have the detail on how you want it done and how you will get it done. You must realize the importance of definitions and love defining things in your life and about your life – Define your mission, define your problem, define your future, define your path and the finer details of your vision. Use your sense of imagination and creativity.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your attitude should not settle for the average when you have what it takes to become the best. You excel by choice and you must be focused like a laser beam. Even the sun, powerful as it is, will not be able to burn a hole into a piece of paper until a magnifying glass is used to channel the power of its rays onto one spot. Focus your intellect and your knowledge to get excellent results.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“No matter how much I care for you I cannot grow for you, you have to do your own growing – it’s your personal responsibility. Make a plan on how you will get the skills and experience required to become a practitioner of note in your area of choice.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Do not lose focus because of small wins or temporary set-backs. You can only score if you keep your eyes on the ball and be certain of where you want to place it even if you are not in physical sight of the goal. Visualise the dream but never take your eyes off the dynamic plan of action.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You must be willing to be disciplined as well as make personal sacrifices. It takes discipline to go through rigorous training and study programs. You need a coach or coaches and sometimes mates to help you stick to your planned program in execution of your responsibilities. To be excellent and effective, the non-essentials must give up time and space in your life – some sacrifices have to be made. Work hard and work smart.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Take your mission and yourself very seriously. Stick to your schedule and keep time. Cut expenditure of time and money from non-core activities and redirect to those that give more value to the pursuit of your purpose. Never embark on your work or a project without a plan, even if it’s just a mental plan. Use the old carpenter’s rule – “Measure twice and cut once.” Do not leave room for substandard results.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Even if you are counted amongst the best, you will slip into mediocrity by remaining comfortable being the worst of the best. You might be relevant, but because your level of effectiveness is in the bottom tier and your impact minimal – you will soon become obscure as your relevance begins to wear off.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Shift from mediocrity to excellence. Mediocrity and Excellence are like jealous suitors fighting for a partner and competing to please him/her, to the extent they do all they can to reproduce in sets of twins. Mediocrity gives birth to Irrelevance and Obscurity, whilst Excellence breeds Relevance and Significance. These sets of twins cannot inhabit the same life, only one compatible pair can co-exist.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Bathing is not negotiable! So is brushing your teeth and washing your underwear, so that you always have a fresh inviting scent around you. People should want to be around you, not avoid you because of unfriendly odours coming out of your mouth, shoes or armpits. Do the best with what you have; even the old can be made clean and hygienic to improve your image.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Be punctual; it shows your respect for other people.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The accumulation of beliefs, knowledge and experiences contribute to our level of success and progress in life, however they also introduce the reality that we are all prejudiced. If not well managed, our personal prejudices can become the mental prison we lock ourselves inside or we use to shut others out. You need to deal with this likely impediment to a success-driven lifestyle.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“First accept the reality that we are all prejudiced because we have things and issues we have biases towards or against, based on our beliefs, thoughts and experiences. Accept that it is possible to differ on opinions, beliefs and philosophies without necessarily becoming inhumane or acrimonious towards each other.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Doubt is a result of more than one internal voice giving differing and contradicting instructions and suggestions concerning a situation or a phase of your success journey. The triggering suggestions may be internal or external factors igniting internal conflict and uncertainty in the face of adversity. Yet inside of you must rise up a voice of authority which silences the disempowering shouts of unbelief. You need to have a deliberate plan to develop that internal voice of authority.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Leave no room for fear and excuses. Be strong in spirit and possess unwavering convictions. Choose to be an optimist and commit to succeed.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Train your emotions to listen to your fundamental empowering beliefs. Be principle-centred and values-driven.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Never stop asking questions. Always take time to reflect and find answers. Stop, Think and Use Your Brain!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your words are powerful containers, carrying blessings or curses depending on what is inside of you. If you harbour bitterness in you, you will speak spitefully and create hurt and hatred in those you speak with. If there is love inside of you, you will release pleasant and caring words that create appreciation, gratitude and warmth in those around you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There should always be a deliberate crafting and packaging of the words you speak so that they produce the kind of results you desire. Enough research has been done in every religion and belief system to support the truth that words have power to create or destroy. This is the reason why all major religions say their prayers. However, your words can only be as powerful and as effective as their sponsor. The words must possess the right substance.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The trusted quality and power of the believed sponsor of your words will have a big impact on the power released in and through your words. You should have sufficient sponsorship to counter the kind of words you do not want to influence your life, thoughts and mission. Contrary words and convincing voices will encounter you on the route to your destiny and they need to be countered with strong conviction and authority.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Do not be cursed by documented findings and so-called facts; invention itself is not yet an antique for the museum. Not every voice has the right to sponsor your beliefs and words.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Slipping into bad attitudes and habits is like a beautiful queen growing older and uglier compared to the defined mission and personal standards. Time and again everyone who is serious about making their success more deliberate needs to stop by the mirror in their own mind and ask, “Mirror, mirror in my mind, am I still on course to succeed in life?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You should be able to criticize and evaluate yourself before others do it. Check for congruity between your defined mission, vision, values and your practiced attitude, behaviour and habits.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The best way for reflection and self-assessment is to hold meetings with yourself. I will pardon you for missing some other meetings, but you must never have an excuse for missing the board meetings you need to hold with yourself – I call these “board meetings between me, myself and I”. The three of us in one place, in a no-holds-barred meeting, where life-changing resolutions are reached to craft my journey to success. As board members we give each other honest feedback.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Once you make the requisite personal commitment to make your success deliberate, that commitment must translate into a definition of higher personal standards meant to depict the true impression of what you have become or are becoming within.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You first compete with yourself before competing against others; if you cannot beat your last best result, do not be surprised if it seems difficult to compete against external competitors.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Generate great impressions. This is a direct result of setting higher standards for yourself in your speech, dress, living environment, grooming, etiquette, study, research and commitment.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You must first become – before you are appointed, conferred or pronounced. Unfortunate challenges and failures are likely to be manifested whenever conferment precedes becoming what you aim to be. Be ready to maturely handle success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“It is amazing, the number of business executives and senior leaders who get to be appointed and elevated to positions of authority on the basis of technical competences whilst lacking essential grooming on basic good manners and customs of conduct that must come from the home training process.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Are you conscious of the scent or odour emanating from your mouth, arm pits, stockings or elsewhere? Are you friendly to your environment? Is your dressing, hair style and make up in line with your defined mission and values? How can you start managing your image and brand for a consistently good impression all the time? Does your image reflect your aspirations?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Build relationships and friendships by finding common experiences or interests instead of getting discouraged by noticeable differences.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you are not sure or you don’t know something, politely ask. Asking is not a sign of being daft, but of confidence.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Allow others to talk about themselves instead of being obsessed about telling them or bragging about yourself and your possessions and achievements. Show a genuine interest in others and allow them to tell their story so you can share the conversation.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Don’t be intimidated and at the same time don’t intimidate.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Appearance matters, we see your presentation before we get a chance to sample the substance within. You might miss a chance for the latter.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Don’t do things or act out your posture and gestures to impress people, just be yourself and portray the confident ‘you’ with that high self-esteem. So relax because you are ‘you’. Be sincere, be authentic. That will be impressive enough.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Connect by listening well and speaking relevantly without being prejudiced or sarcastic. Learn to listen with your eyes as much as you listen with your ears. Generate interest in the person and subject, that way people will become more interested in you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“No matter how much I care for you, you have to do your own growing – it’s your personal responsibility. Muscles do not grow by reading but by lifting weights. Exam grades do not improve by wishing but by studying.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“It is imperative that you grow, because your personal growth and development is one of the most important things to you. Your growth is good for you – it must be deliberate.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“When you face challenges, threats and prospects for failure, when you are out of money or job, when health is deteriorating and death seems to beckon – any hope for success against all those odds takes a solid empowering belief system that will believe – hope is still there. You must choose to adopt positive and empowering beliefs.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“At a higher level you are influenced by deity and the spiritual. Even atheism is based on the belief that there is no God or gods, without deity-acknowledging religion it has no foundation or basis. What is your divine influence, doctrine and reservoir of inspiration to tackle or create the tangible out of the realm of the unseen and the spiritual?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You need to realize there will always be beliefs that seek to limit and others that seek to stretch you to your highest potential. Just because you cannot see or do something, does not mean it is not there or cannot be done.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Programming means your mindset, thought processes and frame of reference must be correctly wired and mapped to enable the incubation of thoughts and ideas that lead to success. Your subconscious mind is key in this process and will always look for ways and means, night and day, to fulfil and implement the thoughts that are always fed into it. It is your faithful servant. I call it the connection between God and man. It is an essential part of the human spirit.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Positive empowering beliefs will enable you to solidify a vision and mission that can bring you to a life of relevance and significant impact. Remember whatever you believe is true - to you. These beliefs must be programmed into your mind – by you (though you will still get input outside your own initiative).” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your values, as guiding principles, will influence your attitude towards yourself, life, other people, work and even challenges or success itself. Your values are a product of your beliefs.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Attitude is the mind-set, the kind of thoughts you process and meditate on, to generate the kind of feelings you have towards life, people and issues. This is what makes you do what you do in the way you do it.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“No one can change your attitude or another person’s attitude – only you can decide to change your own attitude by influencing the whole value chain from programs running in your subconscious mind to beliefs and values you strongly hold.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Emotions or feelings stem from your attitude and they become the basis on which you decide or act. All decisions, choices and actions have some kind of underlying emotional influence. To change the way you feel about someone or something you must first change the way you think about them.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Behaviours and habits are therefore the end result of the entire value chain and cannot be changed in a sustainable manner by scratching the surface - you have to dig deeper. This is why jail time, threats and sanctions without appropriate rehabilitation programs will not change a person unless they embark on a personal journey/program to initiate the process of change from the inner core – how the programs in their brain are wired to influence their beliefs.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Identify and replace any limiting deep-rooted beliefs that are like a solid mental prison, including thoughts like, 'I’m not worthy,' 'I can’t do this,' 'I’m too old to start,' 'I don’t have the qualification or skills to become a better person,' 'I’m always the unlucky one,' 'I have nothing to give/say or contribute” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Because it took you years to become so negative, doubting and dis-empowered – it must now become your daily journey to a life-time of positivity and empowering thoughts, words, actions and beliefs.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Deliberately plan to be exciting and to be excited.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Be deliberate about what you choose to read, watch or listen to – these are source codes to your internal programming.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The deep desire for success must cause a dream to rise to the surface and inspire you to action. The dream must be supported in the physical and natural realm to help you believe more and more in the possibility of its realization.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You must first move from mediocrity to relevance in the realm of your dream, before it can translate into a driving passion that fuels your success. There are no impossibilities in a dream, there are no figures that are too big or obstacles that are unscalable, no distances too far or expertise considered too small – there is unlimited possibility in a dream. Your dream must be bigger than you and inspiring enough to outlive you.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Call your personal board now and discuss the important questions. You cannot invent, re-invent or show creative brilliance without asking pertinent questions. You must demand answers from your life, from your present circumstances or from any challenge you may face. Why can’t you change? What does it take to get different results? What else can you do or try?” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There must be a clear distinction between wishing and believing. A wish is a hazy thread of desires that leaves room for the winds of doubt to toss it about, meaning it might happen by chance or not. A belief has no equivocation; it is clear, stubborn and deliberate in taking hold of what remains yet unseen by the physical eye. If there is no visible way, a belief will draft the way, create the way, walk the path and reach the desired destination.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Positive belief leaves no room for excuses; it questions why the feats and quests cannot be attained. When your beliefs are strong enough, you will not define yourself on the basis of past and present limitations or life events. Your success can only be as big as the size of your beliefs, for it is the size of your beliefs that will either limit your dream or allow it to explode.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Make the difficult choices and adopt the discipline regime required of a person who has set their mind to succeed, kiss mediocrity goodbye and translate an ordinary life to the extraordinary. It takes personal commitment of time and resources, and a sacrifice of non-essential pleasures to move towards success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The challenge therefore, as you strive for success, is to make it a habit to live your life on purpose. You must learn to make deliberate plans and then practice the art and science of doing things on purpose.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The aim is to produce specific results by your actions, so you begin to do things on purpose. If I leave things to chance, I am losing the plot to make success deliberate, meaning I am increasing my chances of failing in any given task.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“He is a trouble causer who acts without intent. In other words, living on purpose means you must act with known intent. Develop an objective sense that asks the why questions as you pull out action thoughts. Why do I want to do this? Why do I want to do it now? Why do I want to stop this? Why do I want to enter into this agreement? Why do I want to change? You will discover that when you have a known intent, you have enough motivation to sustain the success of your decision.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you just want to do something because it is a customary new year resolution, then soon enough the year will get a bit older, and the strength of your decision will also begin to wear off.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Let your resolution and confession be, 'I will change these things because I want to succeed, and I want to succeed because it will bring me the happiness I seek and desire.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Never underestimate the power of thought. It takes days and nights of pre-meditating ideas, thoughts, pictures and visions of what you would call success. Allow your mind to be pregnant with the thought of success and how you want to achieve it. This will enable you not to be shocked by your own success when you finally achieve it, because you would have lived it countless times before.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“When your own success shocks you, you fail to sustain it and it becomes a curse instead of a blessing. Think through issues and make considerations before you encounter the real situation. Companies invest billions in research and development, including models and simulations to increase chances of success – all in an attempt to make success deliberate for a particular project.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Whilst your memory is as sharp as the most reliable computer, it is always wiser to write things down. Pre-meditation helps the refining process, taking out the undesirable elements from a dream or vision, even mounting the courage to face and overcome challenges before they appear in reality.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Deliberately feed your subconscious mind by acquiring quality input through the conscious and sensory mind. You need to be aware of your need to be successful in life or any of its endeavours. You need to be aware of your potential and possess the strong desire to succeed. Success is possible and you deserve to succeed.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You must succeed! Not by accident, but deliberately! You are able to succeed – now you must be willing to succeed and this must reflect in the way you spend your life.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Aligning your values and beliefs to your behaviour, increases your chances of being effective at living a fulfilling life without the stress of guilt-consciousness, internal strife or internal conflict” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Your personal brand must exude who you are, what you stand for, specifies your target market, what value you intend to add to them and the unique offering through which you will do that.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Understand you are neither inferior nor superior; you are just the best of who you are supposed to be. You have set standards for yourself and are ready to meet them.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Whilst you can be a stepping stone to help others succeed, you are not a dirty mat to be abused by others.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There should be a healthy ‘stubbornness’, assertiveness and confidence that comes from knowledge of your clear vision, mission, values and personal brand.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You can and should stand up for who you are and what you represent, without fear or prejudice. You take the promises you have made to yourself and to others very seriously.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The major purpose of defining and understanding yourself is to be able to come up with an objective strategy to map your success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Leveraging your personal strengths means you will also need to become clearer about those strengths. It is easier to build on what you are already good at than start from your weaker areas. Take time to list down your strengths and reflect on them.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Personal growth by tackling the ‘big-picture” through focusing on the things you have power to influence is more effective and less stressful.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Remain aware of your weak points; not knowing or choosing to ignore them, means creating dangerous ‘blind-spots’ in the path to your success.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“The ostrich-approach of burying your head in the sand, when confronting your areas of weakness, becomes a self-set trigger for failure.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“What are the obvious temptations and inclinations that consistently call me or entice me to go against my personal beliefs, values and standards? You don’t need a prophet for this!” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“If you check your personal blind spots, you can be able to guard against focusing on what you cannot do, but reduce the areas of weakness by taking their space with more of your strengths.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Reprogram your life and mind-set by replacing the bad with the positive, the weakness with the strength.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There is no point knowing your mission if you cannot see the area of need for that mission.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“You will only become significant in life, by solving the unique set of problems only you and your mission are meant to solve.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“There remains unique questions calling for a unique mission like yours to answer – and that is your key to significance. Find them and be the answer.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"
"“Self-discovery is a journey of questioning yourself.” ― Archibald Marwizi, Making Success Deliberate"

These secret expectations play a sinister part in many of the great tragedies of our lives: failed marriages, dissipated dreams, abandoned careers, outcast family, deserted children, and discarded friendships.We readily forget what we once knew as children: our flaws are not only natural but integral to our beings. They are interwoven into our soul’s DNA and yet we continually reject the crooked, wrinkled, mushy parts of our life rather than embrace them as the very essence of our beings.I once believed that aiming for perfection would land me in the realm of excellence. This, however, may not be the trajectory of how things happen. In fact, the pursuit of perfection may be the biggest obstacle to becoming whole.It seems essential to value hard work and determination and yet recognize that the road to excellence is littered with mistakes and subsequent lessons.

If you will have that precision out of them, and make their fingers measure degrees like cogwheels, and their arms strike curves like compasses, you must unhumanize them. All the energy of their spirits must be given to make cogs and compasses of themselves....On the other hand, if you will make a man of the working creature, you cannot make a tool. Let him but begin to imagine, to think, to try to do anything worth doing; and the engine-turned precision is lost at once.
