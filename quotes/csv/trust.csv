"“For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow. Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life. A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail. A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live. When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all. A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother. So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.” ― Herman Hesse, Bäume: Betrachtungen und Gedichte"

"“Never be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.” ― Corrie ten Boom"
"“The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them” ― Thomas Merton, No Man Is an Island"
"“I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you.” ― C. JoyBell C."

"“Laugh, even when you feel too sick or too worn out or tired. Smile, even when you're trying not to cry and the tears are blurring your vision. Sing, even when people stare at you and tell you your voice is crappy. Trust, even when your heart begs you not to. Twirl, even when your mind makes no sense of what you see. Frolick, even when you are made fun of. Kiss, even when others are watching. Sleep, even when you're afraid of what the dreams might bring. Run, even when it feels like you can't run any more.And, always, remember, even when the memories pinch your heart. Because the pain of all your experience is what makes you the person you are now. And without your experience---you are an empty page, a blank notebook, a missing lyric. What makes you brave is your willingness to live through your terrible life and hold your head up high the next day. So don't live life in fear. Because you are stronger now, after all the crap has happened, than you ever were back before it started.” ― Alysha Speer"
"“For there to be betrayal, there would have to have been trust first.” ― Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games"
"“You see, you closed your eyes. That was the difference. Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel. And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too--even when you’re in the dark. Even when you’re falling.” ― Mitch Albom, Tuesdays With Morrie"
"“It was one thing to make a mistake; it was another thing to keep making it. I knew what happened when you let yourself get close to someone, when you started to believe they loved you: you'd be disappointed. Depend on someone, and you might as well admit you're going to be crushed, because when you really needed them, they wouldn't be there. Either that, or you'd confide in them and you added to their problems. All you ever really had was yourself, and that sort of sucked if you were less than reliable.” ― Jodi Picoult, Handle with Care"

"“Trust no friend without faults, and love a woman, but no angel.” ― Doris Lessing"

"“Relationships are mysterious. We doubt the positive qualities in others, seldom the negative. You will say to your partner: do you really love me? Are you sure you love me? You will ask this a dozen times and drive the person nuts. But you never ask: are you really mad at me? Are you sure you’re angry? When someone is angry, you don’t doubt it for a moment. Yet the reverse should be true. We should doubt the negative in life, and have faith in the positive.” ― Christopher Pike, Remember Me"
"“It isn't as bad as you sometimes think it is. It all works out. Don't worry. I say that to myself every morning. It all works out in the end. Put your trust in God, and move forward with faith and confidence in the future. The Lord will not forsake us. He will not forsake us. If we will put our trust in Him, if we will pray to Him, if we will live worthy of His blessings, He will hear our prayers.” ― Gordon B. Hinckley"

"“A friend is a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am arrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal, that I may drop even those undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which men never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with which one chemical atom meets another.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson , Essays, First Series"
"“According to Vedanta, there are only two symptoms of enlightenment, just two indications that a transformation is taking place within you toward a higher consciousness. The first symptom is that you stop worrying. Things don't bother you anymore. You become light-hearted and full of joy. The second symptom is that you encounter more and more meaningful coincidences in your life, more and more synchronicities. And this accelerates to the point where you actually experience the miraculous.

"“Love is a verb, not a noun. It is active. Love is not just feelings of passion and romance. It is behavior. If a man lies to you, he is behaving badly and unlovingly toward you. He is disrespecting you and your relationship. The words “I love you” are not enough to make up for that. Don’t kid yourself that they are.” ― Susan Forward, When Your Lover Is a Liar: Healing the Wounds of Deception and Betrayal"

'You can trust us to stick with you through thick and thin--to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours--closer than you keep it yourself.

"“Our bodies have five senses: touch, smell, taste, sight, hearing. But not to be overlooked are the senses of our souls: intuition, peace, foresight, trust, empathy.

JoyBell C."

"“MAKING THE LIE MAKE SENSE:When denial (his or ours) can no longer hold and we finally have to admit to ourselves that we’ve been lied to, we search frantically for ways to keep it from disrupting our lives. So we rationalize. We find “good reasons” to justify his lying, just as he almost always accompanies his confessions with “good reasons” for his lies. He tells us he only lied because…. We tell ourselves he only lied because…. We make excuses for him: The lying wasn’t significant/Everybody lies/He’s only human/I have no right to judge him.Allowing the lies to register in our consciousness means having to make room for any number of frightening possibilities:• He’s not the man I thought he was.• The relationship has spun out of control and I don’t know what to do• The relationship may be over. Most women will do almost anything to avoid having to face these truths. Even if we yell and scream at him when we discover that he’s lied to us, once the dust settles, most of us will opt for the comforting territory of rationalization. In fact, many of us are willing to rewire our senses, short-circuit our instincts and intelligence, and accept the seductive comfort of self-delusion.” ― Susan Forward, When Your Lover Is a Liar: Healing the Wounds of Deception and Betrayal"
"“Know that love is truly timeless.” ― Mary M. Ricksen"
"“Deciding whether or not to trust a person is like deciding whether or not to climb a tree because you might get a wonderful view from the highest branch or you might simply get covered in sap and for this reason many people choose to spend their time alone and indoors where it is harder to get a splinter.” ― Lemony Snicket, The Penultimate Peril"

"“To borrow against the trust someone has placed in you costs nothing at first. You get away with it, you take a little more and a little more until there is no more to draw on.

"“Have you ever seen the stars in the night? See them closely, they will tell you, how to be open, how to love and how to shine and twinkle without any differences and jealousy of other stars.” ― Santosh Kalwar, Quote Me Everyday"
"“You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you. It is easy to say you believe a rope to be strong and sound as long as you are merely using it to cord a box. But suppose you had to hang by that rope over a precipice. Wouldn't you then first discover how much you really trusted it?” ― C.S. Lewis, A Grief Observed"
"“In the present case it is a little inaccurate to say I hate everything. I am strongly in favor of common sense, common honesty and common decency.

"“Abuse manipulates and twists a child’s natural sense of trust and love. Her innocent feelings are belittled or mocked and she learns to ignore her feelings. She can’t afford to feel the full range of feelings in her body while she’s being abused—pain, outrage, hate, vengeance, confusion, arousal. So she short-circuits them and goes numb. For many children, any expression of feelings, even a single tear, is cause for more severe abuse. Again, the only recourse is to shut down. Feelings go underground.” ― Laura Davis, Allies in Healing: When the Person You Love Was Sexually Abused as a Child"

"“I don't feel that way anymore,"" Nico muttered. ""I mean... I gave up on Percy. I was young and impressionable, and I- I don't...""His voice cracked, and Jason could tell the guy was about to get teary-eyed. Whether Nico had really given up on Percy or not, Jason couldn't imagine what it had been like for Nico all those years, keeping a secret that would've been unthinkable to share in the 1940s, denying who he was, feeling completely alone- even more isolated than other demigods.""Nico,"" he said gently, ""I've seen a lot of brave things. But what you did? That was maybe the bravest.” ― Rick Riordan, The House of Hades"
"“Above all, trust in the slow work of God.We are quite naturally impatient in everything to reach the end without delay.We should like to skip the intermediate stages.We are impatient of being on the way to something unknown, something new.And yet it is the law of all progress that it is made by passing through some stages of instability— and that it may take a very long time.And so I think it is with you; your ideas mature gradually—let them grow, let them shape themselves, without undue haste.Don’t try to force them on, as though you could be today what time (that is to say, grace and circumstances acting on your own good will) will make of you tomorrow.Only God could say what this new spirit gradually forming within you will be.Give Our Lord the benefit of believing that his hand is leading you,and accept the anxiety of feeling yourself in suspense and incomplete.” ― Pierre Teilhard de Chardin"

Trust God and believe in good things to come.” ― Jeffrey R. Holland"
"“Few delights can equal the mere presence of one whom we trust utterly.” ― George MacDonald"
"“That was when it was all made painfully clear to me. When you are a child, there is joy. There is laughter. And most of all, there is trust. Trust in your fellows. When you are an adult...then comes suspicion, hatred, and fear. If children ran the world, it would be a place of eternal bliss and cheer. Adults run the world; and there is war, and enmity, and destruction unending. Adults who take charge of things muck them up, and then produce a new generation of children and say, ""The children are the hope of the future."" And they are right. Children are the hope of the future. But adults are the damnation of the present, and children become adults as surely as adults become worm food. Adults are the death of hope.” ― Peter David, Tigerheart"

"“we rarely confide in those who are better than we. Rather, we are more inclined to flee their society. Most often, on the other hand, we confess to those who are like us and who share our weaknesses. Hence we don't want to improve ourselves and be bettered, for we should first have to be judged in default. We merely wish to be pitied and encouraged in the course we have chosen. In short, we should like, at the same time, to cease being guilty and yet not to make the effort of cleansing ourselves.” ― Albert Camus"

"“When someone you love dies, you are given the gift of ""second chances"". Their eulogy is a reminder that the living can turn their lives around at any point. You’re not bound by the past; that is who you used to be. You’re reminded that your feelings are not who you are, but how you felt at that moment. Your bad choices defined you yesterday, but they are not who you are today. Your future doesn’t have to travel the same path with the same people. You can start over. You don’t have to apologize to people that won’t listen. You don’t have to justify your feelings or actions, during a difficult time in your life. You don’t have to put up with people that are insecure and want you to fail. All you have to do is walk forward with a positive outlook, and trust that God has a plan that is greater than the sorrow you left behind. The people of quality that were meant to be in your life won’t need you to explain the beauty of your heart. They already understand what being human is----a roller coaster ride of emotions during rainstorms and sunshine, sprinkled with moments when you can almost reach the stars.” ― Shannon L. Alder"
"“Wait on the Lord"" is a constant refrain in the Psalms, and it is a necessary word, for God often keeps us waiting. He is not in such a hurry as we are, and it is not his way to give more light on the future than we need for action in the present, or to guide us more than one step at a time. When in doubt, do nothing, but continue to wait on God. When action is needed, light will come.” ― J.I. Packer, Knowing God"

"“I know women are taught by other women that they must never admit the full truth to a man. But the highest form of affection is based on full sincerity on both sides. Not being men, these women don't know that in looking back on those he has had tender relations with, a man's heart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct. The better class of man, even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying, is not retained by them. A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of elusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her that, sooner or later, her old admirers feel; under which they allow her to go unlamented to her grave.” ― Thomas Hardy"

So I want you to understand one thing very clearly: No matter what you do or say or plot, no matter how you come down on us, I will never, ever harm you. You're on this table, you're safe... 'cause I'm your medic. And however little we may like or trust each other, we're on the same crew. Got the same troubles, same enemies, and more than enough of both. Now, we could circle each other and growl, sleep with one eye open, but that thought wearies me. I don't care what you've done, I don't know what you're planning on doing, but I'm trusting you.

"“Reality CheckHis lying is not contigent on who you are or what you do. His lying is not your fault. Lying is his choice and his problem, and if he makes that choice with you, he will make it with any other woman he’s with. That doesn’t mean you’re an angel and he’s the devil. It does mean that if he doesn’t like certain things about you, he has many ways to address them besides lying. If there are sexual problems between you, there are many resources available to help you. Nothing can change until you hold him responsible and accountable for lying and stop blaming yourself. The lies we tell ourselves to keep from seeing the truth about our lovers don’t feel like lies. They feel comfortable, familiar, and true. We repeat them like a mantra and cling to them like security blankets, hoping to calm ourselves and regain our sense that the world works the way we believe it ought to. Self-lies are false friends we look to for comfort and protection—and for a short time they may make us feel better. But we can only keep the truth at bay for so long. Our self-lies can’t erase his lies, and as we’ll see, the longer we try to pretend they can, the more we deepen the hurt.” ― Susan Forward"

"“BETRAYALNo failure in Life, whether of love or money, is ever really that simple; it usually involves a type of a shadowy betrayal, buried in a secret, mass grave of shared hopes and dreams.That universal mass grave exists in a private cemetery that most... both those suffering from the loss, but especially those committing the betrayal, refuse to acknowledge its existence.When you realize you've been deeply betrayed, fear really hits you. That's what you feel first. And then it's anger and frustration. Then disspointment and disilussionment.Part of the problem is how little we understand about the ultimate effects and consequences of betrayal on our hearts and spirits; and on trust and respect for our fellow brothers and sisters.In writing, there are only really a few good stories to tell, and in the end, and betrayal and the failure of love is one of the most powerful stories to tell.Tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise- by trading in our integrity and failing to treat life and others in our life, with respect and dignity. That's really where the truest and the most tragic failures comes from... they come making the choice to betray another soul, and in turn, giving up a peice of your own.” ― José N. Harris, Mi Vida"

It expresses a deep desire to transcend our struggles and transform our negative emotions. It commands a life beyond our egos, beyond that part of ourselves that is continually reminding us that we are separate, different and alone. Surrendering allows us to return to our true nature and move effortlessly through the cosmic dance called life. It's a powerful statement that proclaims the perfect order of the universe.When you surrender your will, you are saying, ""Even though things are not exactly how I'd like them to be, I will face my reality. I will look it directly in the eye and allow it to be here."" Surrender and serenity are synonymous; you can't experience one without the other. So if it's serenity you're searching for, it's close by. All you have to do is resign as General Manager of the Universe. Choose to trust that there is a greater plan for you and that if you surrender, it will be unfolded in time. Surrender is a gift that you can give yourself. It's an act of faith. It's saying that even though I can't see where this river is flowing, I trust it will take me in the right direction.” ― Debbie Ford, Spiritual Divorce: Divorce as a Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life"

"“Once, maybe I would have thought you a fool, but...well, that's kind of what trust is, isn't it? A willful self-delusion? You have to shut out that voice that whispers about betrayal, and just hope that your friends aren't going to hurt you.” ― Brandon Sanderson, Mistborn: The Final Empire"
"“I'm not good at having friends. I mean, I can make myself useful to people. I can fit in. I get invited to parties and I can sit at any table I want in the cafeteria.But actually trusting someone when they have nothing to gain from me just doesn't make sense.All friendships are negotiations of power.” ― Holly Black, White Cat"

"“YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BE WEAKAllow yourself to feel whatever you are feeling. Notice any labels you attach to crying or feeling vulnerable. Let go of the labels. Just feel what you are feeling, all the while cultivating moment-to-moment awareness, riding the waves of “up” and “down,” “good” and “bad,” “weak” and “strong,” until you see that they are all inadequate to fully describe your experience.

"“The way of trust is a movement into obscurity, into the undefined, into ambiguity, not into some predetermined, clearly delineated plan for the future. The next step discloses itself only out of a discernment of God acting in the desert of the present moment. The reality of naked trust is the life of the pilgrim who leaves what is nailed down, obvious, and secure, and walks into the unknown without any rational explanation to justify the decision or guarantee the future. Why? Because God has signaled the movement and offered it his presence and his promise.” ― Brennan Manning, Ruthless Trust: The Ragamuffin's Path to God"

"“They sit here in the darkness, trusting. That the coffee will be hot and unpoisoned. That no raging madman will come in with a gun or bomb.It leaves him breathless at times, how much faith people put in one another. So fragile, the social contract: we will all stand by the rules, move with care and gentleness, invest in the infrastructure, agree with the penalties of failure. That this man driving his truck down the street won't, on a whim, angle into the plate glass and end things. That the president won't let his hand hover over the red button and, in moment of rage or weakness, explode the world. The invisible tissue of civilization: so thin, so easily rendable. It's a miracle that it exists at all.” ― Lauren Groff, Arcadia"

"“Max."" Fang let go of my hand. ""Right now, it's really all about—us."" He swooped down to the right in a big semicircle, ending facing me. Slowly we climbed upward, until we were almost vertical, flying straight up to the sun. While carefully synchronizing our wings—they almost touched—Fang leaned in, gently put one hand behind my neck, and kissed me. It was just about as close to heaven as I'll ever get, I guess. I closed my eyes, lost in the feeling of flying and kissing and being with the one person in the world I completely,utterly trusted. When we finally broke apart, we looked down at the others, who were way far below us now. Angel was shading her eyes, looking up at us with a big smile. She was sitting on a dolphin's back, and I hoped soon someone would explain to the dolphin that he shouldn't let Angel take advantage of his good nature. Still looking up at us, Angel gave us a big thumbs-up. ""She approves,"" Fang said with a hint of amusement.""Jeez,"" I wondered aloud. ""Is that a good thing or a bad thing?” ― James Patterson, Max"
"“She sheltered her colors in the dark, where others were blind to see; I caught a glimpse of her lastly when she gave me a chance, before disappearing into the day.

But I missed to late, that what I wasn't looking for, when she left her reasons in the rain.” ― Anthony Liccione"

"“We'll know we've got it right when they choose for themselves,"" he used to say. That doesn't make sense. 'That's what I thought too. I asked him what he meant, but he just shrugged. I don't think he knew himself. But I keep thinking maybe that stray is making exactly the kind of choice he talked about. We're talking about an adult dog, a dog that's been out in the woods for a long time, trying to decide whether or not we can be trusted. Whether this is his place. And it matters to him - he'd rather starve than make the wrong decision.” ― David Wroblewski, The Story of Edgar Sawtelle"

"“And I was -- this is just how I was afraid you'd take it. I knew it, that you'd think this means you were right to be afraid all the time and never feel secure or trust me. I knew it'd be 'See, you're leaving after all when you promised you wouldn't.' I knew it but I'm trying to explain anyway, okay? And I know you probably won't understand this either, but --wait-- just try to listen and maybe absorb this, okay? Ready? Me leaving is not the confirmation of all your fears about me. It is not. It's because of them. Okay? Can you see that? It's your fear I can't take. It's your distrust and fear I've been trying to fight. And I can't anymore. I'm out of gas on it. If I loved you even a little less maybe I could take it. But this is killing me, this constant feeling that I am always scaring you and never making you feel secure. Can you see that?” ― David Foster Wallace, Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"
"“To trust someone is to take the greatest risk of all. (180)” ― Jonathan Kellerman, Blood Test"
"“What kind of woman is still able to trust people after everything she's been through? If she'd been Vin, she would have stabbed him in the back at the first opportunity, and that would have probably been the right thing to do. Yet, this girl just continued to trust. It was like finding a beautiful plant growing alone in a field of burnt ash.” ― Brandon Sanderson, The Hero of Ages"
"“God will never disappoint us… If deep in our hearts we suspect that God does not love us and cannot manage our affairs as well as we can, we certainly will not submit to His discipline. …To the unbeliever the fact of suffering only convinces him that God is not to be trusted, does not love us. To the believer, the opposite is true.” ― Elisabeth Elliot, Discipline: The Glad Surrender"
"“I do not think there is a demonstrative proof (like Euclid) of Christianity, nor of the existence of matter, nor of the good will and honesty of my best and oldest friends. I think all three are (except perhaps the second) far more probable than the alternatives. The case for Christianity in general is well given by Chesterton…As to why God doesn't make it demonstratively clear; are we sure that He is even interested in the kind of Theism which would be a compelled logical assent to a conclusive argument? Are we interested in it in personal matters? I demand from my friend trust in my good faith which is certain without demonstrative proof. It wouldn't be confidence at all if he waited for rigorous proof. Hang it all, the very fairy-tales embody the truth. Othello believed in Desdemona's innocence when it was proved: but that was too late. Lear believed in Cordelia's love when it was proved: but that was too late. 'His praise is lost who stays till all commend.' The magnanimity, the generosity which will trust on a reasonable probability, is required of us. But supposing one believed and was wrong after all? Why, then you would have paid the universe a compliment it doesn't deserve. Your error would even so be more interesting and important than the reality. And yet how could that be? How could an idiotic universe have produced creatures whose mere dreams are so much stronger, better, subtler than itself?” ― C.S. Lewis"

"“Sweet girl, maybe close the world off and look at him for an houror two.This is your fairy. It ain’t perfect and it ain’t honey sweet with roses on the bed.It’s real and raw and ugly at times. But this is your love. Don’t throw it away searching for someone else’s love. Don’t be greedy. Instead, shelter it. Protect it. Capture every second of easy, pull through every storm of hardship. And when you can, look at him, lying next to you, trusting you not to harm him. Trusting you not to go. Be someone’s someone for someone.Be that someone for him.” ― Charlotte Eriksson"
"“For those who feel their lives are a grave disappointment to God, it requires enormous trust and reckless, raging confidence to accept that the love of Jesus Christ knows no shadow of alteration or change. When Jesus said, ""Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy burdened,"" He assumed we would grow weary, discouraged, and disheartened along the way. These words are a touching testimony to the genuine humanness of Jesus. He had no romantic notion of the cost of discipleship. He knew that following Him was as unsentimental as duty, as demanding as love.” ― Brennan Manning, The Ragamuffin Gospel"
"“Love is supposed to be based on trust, and trust on love, it's something rare and beautiful when people can confide in each other without fearing what the other person will think.” ― E.A. Bucchianeri, Brushstrokes of a Gadfly"
"“Are we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us? Are we not perhaps afraid to give up something significant, something unique, something that makes life so beautiful? Do we not then risk ending up diminished and deprived of our freedom? . . . No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship are the doors of life opened wide. Only in this friendship is the great potential of human existence truly revealed. Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation. And so, today, with great strength and great conviction, on the basis of long personal experience of life, I say to you, dear young people: Do not be afraid of Christ! He takes nothing away, and he gives you everything. When we give ourselves to him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ – and you will find true life. Amen.” ― Pope Benedict XVI"

"“Falling in love was as much about receiving as it was giving, was it? It seemed selfish. It was not, though. It was the opposite. Keeping oneself from being loved was to refuse the ultimate gift. He had thought himself done with romantic love. He had thought himself an incurable cynic. He was not, though.He was only someone whose heart and mind, and very soul, had been battered and bruised. It was still - and always - safe to give since there was a certain deal of control to be exerted over giving. Taking, or allowing oneself to receive, was an altogether more risky business. For receiving meant opening up the heart again.Perhaps to rejection.Or disillusionment.Or pain.Or even heart break.It was all terribly risky.And all terribly necessary.And of course, there was the whole issue of trust...” ― Mary Balogh, At Last Comes Love"

He could never give that last small piece - all that was left of his humanity - into someone else's keeping. And now there was Rikki. She let him be whatever he had to be to survive. She didn't ask anything of him. There was no hidden motive. No agenda. Just acceptance. She was different - imperfect, or so she thought - and she knew what it was like to fight to carve out a space for herself. She was willing for him to do thar.” ― Christine Feehan, Water Bound"

"“And what about the lovers who spend hours staring into each other's eyes? Is it a display of trust? 'I will let you in close and trust you not to hurt me while I'm in this vulnerable position.'

Leave the hand open and be. Be at peace. Bend the knee and be small and let God give what God chooses to give because He only gives love and whisper a surprised thanks. This is the fuel for joy's flame. Fullness of joy is discovered only in the emptying of will. And I can empty. I can empty because counting His graces has awakened me to how He cherishes me, holds me, passionately values me. I can empty because I am full of His love. I can trust.” ― Ann Voskamp, One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are"

""I'm just trusting you enough to come back.” ― Jodi Picoult, Vanishing Acts"
"“When we find that God's ways always coincide with our own ways, it's time to question who we're really worshipping, God or ourselves. The latter moves the nature of godliness from the King to our servant to a slave, a deduction into the realm of selfhood and then the lower, slavehood. It's a spiritual mathematics in that men who need God in his godhood are humble yet strong and spiritually ambitious while men who need a slave in their selfhood are ultimately paralyzed and will remain paralyzed.” ― Criss Jami, Killosophy"

"“People with trust issues also have faith and humility issues. You can't ask the world to rise to your expectations, yet not meet that same standard for others. The notion that God didn't hurt me, but you did becomes an illogical argument for many. People who are trying to love you feel that they can never meet your definition of love because it is one sided or has rules that don't apply to you, as well. This is when the teachings of Christ become distorted. Forgiveness, compassion, love, kindness and second chances becomes a game. People in your life feel they must win it to receive it, which is far from the unconditional love God gives us. In the end, the person with trust issues find themself on a journey of perfection seeking out people incapable of mistakes like the last person or hurting their self esteem. Sadly, they miss the blessings of growth that come through humbly accepting they are also flawed and make mistakes. They miss the blessings of faith because they don't invite God into their heart, so he can help them overcome their cycle of pain. They miss the peace that comes from forgiveness and being forgiven. But most of all, they miss out on the beautiful people God brings into their life who love them so much.” ― Shannon L. Alder"

"“The hardest thing in life may be to learn to truly trust that there is something noble and generative in ourselves. This is a greater sense of the notion of believing in our self; to truly believe in oneself means to uncover the inner core of imagination and authenticity that can also be called the genius within us. When we connect to the inner resident of the soul, we also learn how we are woven to the Soul of the World.” ― Michael Meade, The Genius Myth"

"“I mostly want to remind her of the recipes of healing, and give her my own made-on-the spot remedy for the easing of her pain. I tell her, “Get a pen. Stop crying so you can write this down and start working on it tonight.” My remedy is long. But the last item on the list says: “When you wake up and find yourself living someplace where there is nobody you love and trust, no community, it is time to leave town – to pack up and go (you can even go tonight). And where you need to go is any place where there are arms that can hold you, that will not let you go.” ― bell hooks, Sisters of the Yam: Black Women and Self-Recovery"

"“Along with the trust issues, one of the hardest parts to deal with is the feeling of not being believed or supported, especially by your own grandparents and extended family. When I have been through so much pain and hurt and have to live with the scars every day, I get angry knowing that others think it is all made up or they brush it off because my cousin was a teenager. I was ten when I was first sexually abused by my cousin, and a majority of my relatives have taken the perpetrator's side. I have cried many times about everything and how my relatives gave no support or love to me as a kid when this all came out. Not one relative ever came up to that innocent little girl I was and said ""I am sorry for what you went through"" or ""I am here for you."" Instead they said hurtful things: ""Oh he was young."" ""That is what kids do."" ""It is not like he was some older man you didn't know."" Why does age make a difference? It is a sick way of thinking. Sexual abuse is sexual abuse. What is wrong with this picture? It brings tears to my eyes the way my relatives have reacted to this and cannot accept the truth.

"“There are a hundred ways in which a boy can injure—if not indeed kill—himself. The more adventurous he is and the greater his initiative, the more ways he will find. If you protect him from each of the first hundred, he is sure to find the hundred and first. Though most men can look back on their boyhood and tremble at the narrowness of some of their escapes, most boys do in fact survive more or less intact, and the wise father is the trusting father.” ― Christopher Milne, The Enchanted Places"
"“Well, clearly someone you trust isn’t really someone you should be trusting,” she said without thinking, and regretted it when Terrible glanced at her. He did it fast, just a quick cut of his eyes in her direction and then away again, but she saw it. She felt it. It was starting already. She wished she could say she was surprised, wished she hadn’t been waiting for it, expecting it the way she expected rain from black clouds overhead. Nothing in the world was permanent, especially not happiness. She’d always known that. She just wished life would stop proving her right.” ― Stacia Kane, Sacrificial Magic"
"“People LOVE change (when it's about changing others). People HATE change (when it's about changing themselves).” ― Richie Norton"
"“Water flows from high places to low places. That is the nature of gravity. Emotions also seem to act according to gravity. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don’t trust. Hirai saw Kei as a confidante with whom she could share anything. The emotional gravity was strong. Kei was able to accept anything—forgive anything—that Hirai let flow out. A single kind word from Kei could cut the cords of tension that ran through her.” ― Toshikazu Kawaguchi, Before the Coffee Gets Cold"

"“Have you really not noticed, then, that here of all places, in this private, personal solitude that surrounds me, I have turned to you? All the memories of my youth speak to me as I walk, just as the sea shells crunch under my feet on the beach. The crash of every wave awakens far-distant reverberations within me... I hear the rumble of bygone days, and in my mind the whole endless series of old passions surges forward like the billows. I remember my spasms, my sorrows, gusts of desire that whistled like wind in the rigging, and vast vague longings that swirled in the dark like a flock of wild gulls in a stormcloud... On whom should I lean, if not on you? My weary mind turns for refreshment to the thought of you as a dusty traveler might sink onto a soft and grassy bank...” ― Gustave Flaubert"
"“Stop putting yourself in danger.

"“If we rely on anything else besides faith to maintain the practice of the presence of God, we will certainly fail, whether this is our feelings, or experiences, or sincerity, or good intentions, or reasonings, or plans. The reason these things will fail while faith will not fail is that all these things depend on us, while faith depends on God. It is a gift of God.” ― Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners"

"“Then go,"" Dan said. When Nathaniel looked back at her, she stressed, ""But come back to us as soon as they're done with you, okay? We'll figure this out as a team."" ""As a family."" Nicky attempted a smile. It was weak, but it was encouraging. This had to be a cruel dream. Their forgiveness threatened to burn Nathaniel up from the inside-out, as healing as it was damning. He didn't deserve their friendship or their trust. He'd never be able to repay them for rallying behind him like this. He could try the rest of his life, however long it was going to be now that Stuart was in the picture and Nathan was out, and he'd always fall short.” ― Nora Sakavic, The King's Men"

"“When Americans think of freedom, we usually imagine a contest between a lone individual and a powerful government. We tend to conclude that the individual should be empowered and the government kept at bay. This is all well and good. But one element of freedom is the choice of associates, and one defense of freedom is the activity of groups to sustain their members. This is why we should engage in activities that are of interest to us, our friends, our families. These need not be expressly political: Václav Havel, the Czech dissident thinker, gave the example of brewing good beer. Insofar as we take pride in these activities, and come to know others who do so as well, we are creating civil society. Sharing in an undertaking teaches us that we can trust people beyond a narrow circle of friends and families, and helps us to recognize authorities from whom we can learn. The capacity for trust and learning can make life seem less chaotic and mysterious, and democratic politics more plausible and attractive.” ― Timothy Snyder, On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century"

"“Neil felt a half-second from losing his mind, but then Andrew said his name and Neil's thoughts ground to a startled halt. He was belatedly aware of his hand at his ear and his fingers clenched tight around his phone. He didn't remember pulling it from his pocket or making the decision to dial out. He lowered it and tapped a button, thinking maybe he'd imagined things, but Andrew's name was on his display and the timer put the call at almost a minute already. Neil put the phone back to his ear, but he couldn't find the words for the wretched feeling that was tearing away at him. In three months championships would be over. In four months he'd be dead. In five months the Foxes would be right back here for summer practices with six new faces. Neil could count his life on one hand now. On the other hand was the future he couldn't have: vice-captain, captain, Court. Neil had no right to mourn these missed chances. He'd gotten more than he deserved this year; it was selfish to ask for more. He should be grateful for what he had, and gladder still that his death would mean something. He was going to drag his father and the Moriyamas down with him when he went, and they'd never recover from the things he said. It was justice when he'd never thought he'd get any and revenge for his mother's death. He thought he'd come to terms with it but that hollow ache was back in his chest where it had no right to be. Neil felt like he was drowning. Neil found his voice at last, but the best he had was, ""Come and get me from the stadium."" Andrew didn't answer, but the quiet took on a new tone. Neil checked the screen again and saw the timer flashing at seventy-two seconds. Andrew had hung up on him. Neil put his phone away and waited. It was only a couple minutes from Fox Tower to the Foxhole Court, but it took almost fifteen minutes for Andrew to turn into the parking lot. He pulled into the space a couple inches from Neil's left foot and didn't bother to kill the engine. Kevin was in the passenger seat, frowning silent judgment at Neil through the windshield. Andrew got out of the car when Neil didn't move and stood in front of Neil. Neil looked up at him, studying Andrew's bored expression and waiting for questions he knew wouldn't come. That apathy should have grated against his raw nerves but somehow it steadied him. Andrew's disinterest in his psychological well-being was what had drawn Neil to him in the first place: the realization that Andrew would never flinch away from whatever poison was eating Neil alive.” ― Nora Sakavic, The King's Men"

You don’t have to do this alone.Only even as he thought this, Bean knew it wasn’t true. If it could be done, Ender was the one who would have to do it. All those months when Bean refused to see Ender, hid from him, it was because he couldn’t bear to face the fact that Ender was what Bean only wished to be — the kind of person on whom you could put all your hopes, who could carry all your fears, and he would not let you down, would not betray you.I want to be the kind of boy you are, thought Bean.

"“Remember that our Heavenly Father knows us perfectly and knows what's best for us . . . . Surely, His knowledge is greater than ours. We just have to have faith in Him. If we don't, well, that doesn't change what happened, it just makes us more miserable because we refuse to trust His will. Our Heavenly Father wants us to have joy. And happiness.

"“Love is not a thing you can pick up and throw into the gutter and pick up again as the fancy takes you. I am a person, very unfortunately for you, with a quite peculiar dread of thrusting myself or my affections on any one, of in any way outstaying my welcome. The man I would love would be the man I could trust to love me for ever. I do not trust you. I did outstay my welcome once. I did get thrown into the gutter, and came near drowning in that sordid place.” ― Elizabeth von Arnim, Fraulein Schmidt and Mr Anstruther"

It is a natural thing for a female to hold secrets within her breast until the time is ripe to release them. Does it not follow the way in which her body is formed? A woman is made with that dark and mysterious recess that can grow a child safely until the child is ready to come out onto the birthing bed.

"“Evie.” She glanced at Sebastian. Whatever she saw in his face caused her to walk around the bed to him. “Yes,” she said with a concerned frown. “Dearest, this is going to help you—”“No.” It would kill him. It was difficult enough already to fight the fever and the pain. If he was further weakened by a long bloodletting he wouldn’t be able to hold on any longer. Frantically Sebastian tugged at his tautly stretched arm, but the binding held fast and the chair didn’t even wobble. Bloody hell. He stared up at his wife wretchedly, battling a wave of light-headedness. “No,” he rasped. “Don’t…let him…”“Darling,” Evie whispered, bending over to kiss his shaking mouth. Her eyes were suddenly shiny with unshed tears. “This may be your best chance—your only chance—”“I’ll die. Evie…” Rising fear caused blackness to streak across his vision, but he forced his eyes to stay open. Her face became a blur. “I’ll die,” he whispered again.“Lady St. Vincent,” came Dr. Hammond’s steady, kind voice, “your husband’s anxiety is quite understandable. However, his judgment is impaired by illness. At this time, you are the one who is best able to make decisions for his benefit. I would not recommend this procedure if I did not believe in its efficacy. You must allow me to proceed. I doubt Lord St. Vincent will even remember this conversation.”Sebastian closed his eyes and let out a groan of despair. If only Hammond were some obvious lunatic with a maniacal laugh…someone Evie would instinctively mistrust. But Hammond was a respectable man, with all the conviction of someone who believed he was doing the right thing. The executioner, it seemed, could come in many guises.Evie was his only hope, his only champion. Sebastian would never have believed it would come to this…his life depending on the decision of an unworldly young woman who would probably allow herself to be persuaded by the Hammond’s authority. There was no one else for Sebastian to appeal to.He felt her gentle fingers at the side of his fevered face, and he stared up at her pleadingly, unable to form a word. Oh God, Evie, don’t let him—“All right,” Evie said softly, staring at him. Sebastian’s heart stopped as he thought she was speaking to the doctor…giving permission to bleed him. But she moved to the chair and deftly untied Sebastian’s wrist, and began to massage the reddened skin with her fingertips.She stammered a little as she spoke. “Dr. H-Hammond…Lord St. Vincent does not w-want the procedure. I must defer to his wishes.”To Sebastian’s eternal humiliation, his breath caught in a shallow sob of relief.“My lady,” Hammond countered with grave anxiety, “I beg you to reconsider. Your deference to the wishes of a man who is out of his head with fever may prove to be the death of him. Let me help him. You must trust my judgment, as I have infinitely more experience in such matters.”Evie sat carefully on the side of the bed and rested Sebastian’s hand in her lap. “I do respect your j-j—” She stopped and shook her head impatiently at the sound of her own stammer. “My husband has the right to make the decision for himself.”Sebastian curled his fingers into the folds of her skirts. The stammer was a clear sign of her inner anxiety, but she would not yield. She would stand by him. He sighed unsteadily and relaxed, feeling as if his tarnished soul had been delivered into her keeping.” ― Lisa Kleypas, Devil in Winter"

"“Bridge-players tell me that there must be some money on the game 'or else people won't take it seriously'. Apparently it's like that. Your bid - for God or no God, for a good God or the Cosmic Sadist, for eternal life or nonentity - will not be serious if nothing much is staked on it.

No. Especially if the two pawns have their heads down together over a quiet beer or two.""""You know,"" Anton said in a slightly surprised voice, ""I just don't understand how you can carry on living if you see the world like that. I'd just go and hang myself.""""So you don't have any counterarguments to offer?""Anton took a gulp of beer too. The wonderful thing about this natural Czech beer was that even if you drank lots of it, it still didn't make your head or your body feel heavy... Or was that an illusion?""Not a single one,"" Anton admitted. ""Right now, this very moment, not a single one. But I'm sure you're wrong. It's just difficult to argue about the colors of the rainbow with a blind man. There's something missing in you... I don't know what exactly.

"“Government surveillance, with its invasive reach into the private lives of citizens, is an egregious violation of the principles that underpin a free and just society. The emotional toll is staggering, as the constant awareness of being monitored erodes the sense of autonomy and security essential for individual well-being. Trust, a cornerstone of any healthy democracy, is shattered, breeding an environment of suspicion and fear. The historical resonance of unlawful surveillance, from oppressive regimes to modern controversies, serves as a stark reminder of the perilous consequences when the state oversteps its bounds. The unlawfulness of such surveillance is not just a legal matter but a moral imperative to safeguard the sanctity of private lives and preserve the emotional health of a free society.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Hope is a slighter, tougher thing even than trust, he thought, pacing his room as the soundless, vague lightning flashed overhead. In a good season one trusts life; in a bad season one only hopes. But they are of the same essence: they are the mind's indispensable relationship with other minds, with the world, and with time. Without trust, a man lives, but not a human life; without hope, he dies.” ― Ursula K. Le Guin, City of Illusions"

Even Esther, who had known she might die when she approached the king without an invitation, had chosen to obey him rather than pursue her own safety.Roxannah exhaled. That seemed her own path now. Obedience, even though it meant walking under the ominous shadow of disaster. Adin said God would help her, and she believed him. Whatever the outcome.” ― Tessa Afshar, The Queen's Cook"

"“Christianity set itself the goal of fulfilling man’s unattainable desires, but for that very reason ignored his attainable desires. By promising man eternal life, it deprived him of temporal life, by teaching him to trust in God’s help it took away his trust in his own powers; by giving him faith in a better life in heaven, it destroyed his faith in a better life on earth and his striving to attain such a life.

"“Trust is a notoriously vulnerable good, easily wounded and not at all easily healed.Trust is not always a good, to be preserved. There must be some worthwhile enterprise in which the trusting and trusted parties are involved, some good bread being kneaded, for trust to be a good thing. If the enterprise is evil, a producer of poisons, then the trust that improves its workings will also be evil, and decent people will want to destroy, not to protect, that form of trust. A death squad may consist of wholly trustworthy and, for a while at least, sensibly trusting coworkers. So the first thing to be checked, if our trust is to become self-conscious, is the nature of the enterprise whose workings are smoothed by merited trust.” ― Annette Baier"

Examples from history, such as the misuse of surveillance by authoritarian regimes, serve as stark warnings against the encroachment of unchecked power into the private lives of citizens.

Lusting after her, full of sweet words, then just walking away. Leaving her alone. Good thing she's used to it by now, isn't it? Otherwise you might have hurt her. Otherwise you just might have broken that poor girl's heart” ― Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear"

"“Formation may be the best name for what happens in a circle of trust, because the word refers, historically, to soul work done in community. But a quick disclaimer is in order, since formation sometimes means a process quite contrary to the one described in this book----a process in which the pressure of orthodox doctrine, sacred text, and institutional authority is applied to the misshapen soul in order to conform it to the shape dictated by some theology. This approach is rooted in the idea that we are born with souls deformed by sin, and our situation is hopeless until the authorities ""form"" us properly. But all of that is turned upside down by the principles of a circle of trust: I applaud the theologian who said that ""the idea of humans being born alienated from the Creator would seem an abominable concept."" Here formation flows from the belief that we are born with souls in perfect form. As time goes on, we subject to powers of deformation, from within as well as without, that twist us into shapes alien to the shape of the soul. But the soul never loses its original form and never stops calling us back to our birhtright integrity.” ― Parker J.

"“Nowadays… deals are transactional rather than personal. Instead of placing your faith in a person, you get lawyers to write safeguards into the contract. This is an historic shift from a trust economy to a risk economy. But trust is not a dispensable luxury. It is the very basis of our social life. Many scholars believe that capitalism had religious roots because people could trust other people who, feeling that they were answerable to God, could be relied on to be honest in business. A world without trust is a lonely and dangerous place.” ― Jonathan Sacks"
"“But if I could just get som ehint, some sign..."" Conchita smiles, without humor, but with great affection. ""That's the point behind faith,"" she says.

After all that talk of taking me for my word—”“This isn’t about trust.”“That is precisely what this is about.” Her fingers fisted in her skirts. “Because I’ve trusted you.”It hurt him to hear it. He didn’t know what else to do. He had no contacts left. He was walking around now like a blind man. He didn’t need the added weight of her safety on his conscience. Caine’s eyes fell away again. “Maybe you shouldn’t.”That earned him a flustered: “You told me to!” ― V.S. Carnes"

"“There is a saying from a Persian poet: “ When I run after what I think I want, my days are a furnace of stress and anxiety; if I sit in my own place of patience, what I need flows to me ”. ... Effortless freedom is not about laziness or disengagement. It is about trusting in timing and allowing space for life to unfold. It is the art of pursuing goals with passion but without attachment to specific results.” ― Ajmal, from the book ""Borders of the Inner World"""
"“We place an intention into the world-a wish, a prayer, a dream, and then we wait. In our culture of instant results, waiting can feel like failure. Yet waiting is its own kind of art. It is a posture of trust that something unseen is unfolding even when nothing visible happens. It asks us to surrender our timelines and to be fully present where we are” ― Ajmal, from the book ""Borders of the Inner World"""
"“Faith is not passivity; it is surrender with trust. It is opening our hands and hearts, letting go of the illusion of control, and resting in the decree of the Most Merciful. In that surrender, there is profound peace. What the Sustainer chooses for us carries wisdom, even when it does not align with our own plans” ― Ajmal, from the book ""Borders of the Inner World"""
"“You don’t find freedom by controlling life; you find it by trusting it.” ― Shamail Aijaz, The Calm Within the Storm: Leading Beyond Ego"
"“Is it worth taking a risk?Sometimes the comfort zone is more dangerous than the risk itself. It feels safe, but it quietly holds you back from growing. Life starts to change when you stop letting fear decide your direction and choose to take the first step forward.When you trust that Allah is the best of planners, uncertainty becomes part of the journey, not the obstacle. Faith is not about waiting for everything to be clear. It is about moving with trust, even when the path ahead is not fully visible.” ― Abdul Wahid Sarguroh"

Use an Authenticator App (like Google Authenticator) for 2FA, as it is more secure than SMS (text message) verification.Transition Gradually:Don't immediately change the profile picture, handle (@name), bio, and delete all old tweets. This sudden, drastic change is a huge red flag for X's algorithms and can trigger an automatic suspension.What to do: Make small, gradual changes over several days or weeks to make the transition look more ""natural."" ❖ Extra Tips: A Checklist for Vetting & Security ❖If you decide to proceed despite the risks, here are the extra tips and precautions to take before and after a purchase.Before You BuyCheck Follower Quality (Not Just Quantity): A high follower count is meaningless if they are all bots.Red Flag: An account with 100K followers but only 2-3 likes or retweets per post is likely full of fake or ""zombie"" followers.What to do: Ask for a read-only analysis of the account's analytics. Use free online tools (Twitter audit tools) to spot-check the followers for bot activity.Verify Account Authenticity & History:Tweet History: Does the account have a consistent, long-term post history, or are there huge, unexplained gaps?Engagement: Do the replies and comments on posts look genuine, or are they generic spam?Niche: Is the account's audience relevant to your needs? An account about crypto will not be useful if you plan to tweet about cooking.Suspension History: Ask the seller if the account has ever been suspended or flagged. A previously flagged account is at a much higher risk of being banned again.Understand the Security Risk:The ""Pull-Back"" Scam: The most common scam is when the seller ""recovers"" the account after you pay them. They can do this if they still have access to the original recovery email or phone number.Stolen Accounts: The account you are buying may have been hacked or stolen from its original owner.❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖Just Knock us For Instant ReplyEmail : abusmmteam@gmail.com❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖WhatsApp: ‪+1 (579) 300-8561❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖Telegram: Abusmms❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖❖” ― Brand, Safety, Buy Twitter Accounts, Aged Compliant, Trust, Stable"

And they leave the playground, or whereever? They maybe even go a ways down the street until their kid comes crying and running behind them, begging not to be abandoned, promising to be good.

God cannot be believed in, and those who believed in God are deceiving themselves. A real trust in God is not a belief, it is an insight and experience. God has to be experienced. When you do not have an experience, you are open to experience. In that freedom something can transpire.In that silence and emptiness, you are open for something from the beyond to transpire like a breeze. You cannot see it, but you will feel it.

"“The sea may rise with many storms, but a strong boat and a brave captain can still reach the shore. Outside challenges can be faced with courage and preparation, but the real danger is not always outside — it often comes from within. If the people inside the boat themselves try to sink it, then neither the strength of the boat nor the courage of the captain can save it.

"“In the final image, he is sitting atop the horse. We have not witnessed a victory or a conquering, but a love scene, a man who knows innately how connection happens, how we traverse emotional distance, how we calm one another's fears.Similarly, toward the end of the film, Brady goes to visit Lane. He is wearing his cowboy hat, green rodeo shirt, jeans, and a bandanna tied around his neck as if he's ready to go riding. With the help of the nurses at the rehab facility, he dresses Lane in boots, jeans, and his old maroon-striped rodeo shirt. Brady puts Lane's cowboy hat atop his head: ""We don't want you to get a sunburn,"" he says. With great difficulty, they ease Lane over a saddle propped up on parallel bars. Brady holds the reins as if he is the horse and takes Lane riding again.""You're loping off into the distance,"" he says as Lane struggles to stay upright. Lane's head falls and Brady cajoles it back up with the patience of a parent teaching a child to ride a bike.Together they are in a rehab facility loping, smiling, tilting, riding, Brady talking softly, lovingly. Brady's man talk soothes me. I have been the horse and I have been Lane, broken through a transition, learning to allow my body to feel pressure, to be cajoled to walk two steps forward, to trust someone enough to help me imagine what it would be like to lope along in my cowboy hat protecting me from sunburn, to learn what it means to talk like a man.” ― P.

It’s about waking up each day and choosing to stay committed, even when things get difficult. Weddings are about making promises in front of others. Marriage is about honoring those promises in private—during ordinary days, tough conversations, financial stress, and moments of silence. A wedding is for a day, but marriage is built over years, slowly, with love, patience, forgiveness, and mutual growth. Anyone can plan a wedding, but nurturing a marriage takes real work, real understanding, and a shared willingness to keep trying.” ― Abdul Wahid Sarguroh"

No one had ever trusted him before, no one had cared to find out and foster the good in him, and no one had suspected how much there was hidden away in the breast of the neglected boy, going fast to ruin, yet quick to feel and value sympathy and help.

Curiously, though, mortals very rarely inherit the memories of their ancestors. This absence of memories makes it all too simple, at times, for one to overlook or disconnect from their heritage, as if the threads of lineage and legacy can be easily loosened by the passage of time. And the essence of one’s forgotten heritage continues to flow within each person’s veins like poison.

It is safer to beat vulnerability to the punch and strive to control your surroundings.It is safer to treat hope as a wish. Hope then becomes something ethereal that you wish upon a star and then you continue on controlling your outcome. Or holding steadfast to hope–which really is your version of that “supposed-to” you want to see happen–as a symbol of your faith. This is not hope. Hope involves more of you and your soul than wishing it up to God. (Look out vulnerability!) It is easier to believe you can “easy button” this to God but a life of hope involves your guttiness.” ― Brenda Seefeldt Amodea, Trust Issues With God: Because Life Is Unfair: Bible Study, With Video Access"

But it's the thought we should keep in our hearts daily. Embrace their quirks, laugh at their mistakes, & cheer their triumphs. Show them that your love isn’t tied to their report cards or soccer goals but to their unique selves. It builds a lifetime of trust, acceptance, and maybe a few funny stories along the way.” ― Life is Positive"

"“I began to question the world and other people from a young age. I suppose that gave me a sense of emotional distance, a lack of trust in future friendships and relationships; I would assume a friendly and open manner, a cloak of safety. The price you pay is a fear of commitment and all the loneliness that entails. I was quietly angry, always have been. I still feel it, but I’m working on it. If you’re anything like me you have to recognise this well of poison that we carry, isolate the reason why we’re always ready to spring up like a cobra and bite at any time, any place, anyone.

"“Though normally the handshake simply confirmed the trustworthiness of an agreement, with perhaps an aura of divine protection, Attic grave reliefs suggest a further extension of the idea for they ""show handshaking as a symbol of Faith at the parting between the dead and the living. Thus, handshaking was not only a sign of agreement among the living, but the gesture of trust and faith in the supreme departure."" With us the handshake is hardly a conscious gesture, but nonetheless one does not expect to be attacked by someone with whom one has just shaken hands. A refusal of a proffered handshake, however, would make the ritual gesture conscious indeed: breaking the ritual raises ominous questions that would require an explanation.” ― Robert N.

"“Listen well Ghini. Belief, faith, and trust . . . all three are things that’re incredibly different, but get mixed up. You can choose to believe in something like God or monsters. You can have faith that God looks out for you, and that locking yer door keeps ya safe from the monsters. Trust is different. You trust the clergy to guide your faith, not because they have to, but because they want to. You trust that the silver bullet does the trick against the monster, not because you have to, but because that’s how others tell you they stopped it before you.If you don’t want to believe Bernie, well that’s yours to decide, but I tell you what, there’s plenty of this world that we don’t understand. Yet, all us adults got a parental instinct. One that’s programmed into us through evolution. And this old man’s instincts believe that kid. I have faith that he is a good man and wouldn’t try to dupe me like that. But most importantly, I trust him with my life.” ― A.J. Humphreys, Spring"
"“Meditation is the beginning of a long journey. If you allow the journey much can happen, but it depends on you and how much you allow. It is difficult to allow, because it needs trust. It needs trust, because the journey includes challenges and taking risks. It is a journey from the known into the unknown. They journey moves into unknown territory, where you have to leave the ego aside. You have to leave your strategies of self-defense, resistance and security. You have to leave the shore on which you have lived and move towards the vast ocean. If one takes the risk of dropping the ego, the other shore is reached immediately, so be ready for the ultimate journey, and be fearless in absolute trust.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, Man is Part of the Whole: Silence, Love, Joy, Truth, Compassion, Freedom and Grace"

And then they had the face they wore to stare down at their peas as they avoided the gaze of their wife across the dinner table. Worse still, she knew, she knew, that there were some very respectable, dignified, and exceedingly polite gentlemen who wore quite another face entirely behind closed doors. This was a cruel face of power wielded over another--a horse, a servant, even a wife.” ― Olivia Elliott, A Dangerous Man to Trust?"

"“Happiness only happens in the heart. It is only in the heart that anything of real value, of eternal value, grows. It is only in the heart that love, joy, silence, truth, compassion, freedom and God grow.The functioning of the heart and the head are totally opposed to each other. Happiness never happens in the head. The head is like a desert. Nothing grows in the head. And we are trained for the head, which becomes a problem in our life. The head is based on doubt, and the heart is based on trust. Our whole training in the education systemis doubt, thinking, logic, reasoning and questioning. That is not the way of the heart. There is very few people, who actually know that the heart exists. For many people the heart is just a metaphor, and at the most the heart is a mechanism for the blood. But that is not the heart that the mystics have talked about. There is a center deep inside you,and that center can only be known through trust. Meditation is a jump into trust. it is a love affair with God, the divine. The head will condemn it. But don't listen to the head. Listen to the heart. The heart is the voice of God.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, Man is Part of the Whole: Silence, Love, Joy, Truth, Compassion, Freedom and Grace"

"“Government surveillance is a blatant violation of our fundamental right to privacy, an intrusion into the sacred space where personal thoughts and actions unfold. Beyond its legal ramifications, the emotional toll is profound, eroding the very fabric of trust that binds citizens to their government. This unwarranted scrutiny transforms society into a panopticon, where individuals feel perpetually observed, stifling genuine self-expression and fostering an atmosphere of fear. The notion that constant surveillance is necessary for security undermines the principles of democracy, as it sets a dangerous precedent, sacrificing essential liberties in the name of an elusive safety that comes at the cost of our collective freedom.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Government surveillance is a surreptitious infringement on our basic human rights, an affront to the principles of autonomy and individuality that form the bedrock of a just society. Its literal ramifications extend far beyond the boundaries of legality, seeping into the emotional and psychological well-being of individuals who find themselves under constant scrutiny. Trust, once eroded by the overreach of surveillance, becomes a casualty, fragmenting the delicate bond between citizens and their government. Instances of surveillance overreach, both historical and contemporary, reveal the potential for grave abuse, reinforcing the imperative to resist such infringements in the name of preserving our liberties and maintaining the emotional health of our collective consciousness.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Government surveillance is a direct assault on the essence of democracy, a betrayal of the trust citizens place in their elected representatives. The emotional toll inflicted by the knowledge that every move is monitored is a corrosive force that eats away at the psychological well-being of individuals, fostering an environment of paranoia and self-censorship. The damage is not just personal but extends to societal trust, creating a chasm between the governed and those in power. Examples of surveillance overreach, from the dystopian pages of history to contemporary revelations, underscore the urgent need to confront and dismantle the machinery of unlawful surveillance that poses a clear and present danger to the very fabric of our free society.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Government surveillance, beyond its legal implications, wreaks havoc on the emotional landscape of individuals, transforming the very essence of personal freedom into a monitored spectacle. The damage inflicted is not confined to the erosion of privacy; it extends into the realm of trust, fracturing the delicate covenant between citizens and their government. The emotional toll of constant surveillance is immeasurable, creating a pervasive culture of anxiety and self-censorship as individuals grapple with the knowledge that their every move is being scrutinized. Historical instances of surveillance excesses, from the Stasi to contemporary controversies, underscore the urgency of recognizing the unlawfulness of such practices and the imperative to reclaim our right to privacy for the sake of our collective well-being.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Government surveillance is a violation of our intrinsic right to privacy, a breach that extends beyond legal boundaries into the emotional terrain of fear and mistrust. The toll on individuals subjected to constant monitoring is profound, casting a shadow over the very notion of personal freedom. Trust, a cornerstone of any democratic society, crumbles in the face of surveillance overreach, fostering an environment where citizens feel hesitant to express themselves openly. Historical examples, such as the COINTELPRO program, illuminate the dark potential of unchecked government surveillance, highlighting the imperative to acknowledge its unlawfulness and safeguard the emotional well-being and trust that are essential for a thriving society.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Government surveillance is a pernicious assault on the pillars of democracy, casting a long shadow over the emotional and psychological well-being of individuals subjected to constant monitoring. The damage inflicted is twofold: the erosion of privacy and the fracturing of trust. The emotional toll of surveillance is immeasurable, creating a culture of fear and self-censorship that stifles open expression. Historical instances, such as the misuse of surveillance by totalitarian regimes, provide stark warnings against the dangers of unchecked governmental intrusion into private lives. The unlawfulness of surveillance is not merely a legal matter; it is a call to protect the emotional sanctity of citizens and fortify the trust that is foundational to a healthy democratic society.” ― James William Steven Parker"
"“Government surveillance is an egregious violation of personal autonomy, leaving in its wake not only legal ramifications but a trail of emotional turmoil and shattered trust. The emotional toll on individuals living under constant scrutiny is immeasurable, fostering an environment of anxiety and self-censorship. Trust, a cornerstone of democracy, crumbles when citizens become aware of being surveilled, creating a chasm between the governed and those in power. Historical examples, from McCarthyism to contemporary revelations, underscore the profound consequences of unchecked surveillance, emphasizing the urgency to recognize its unlawfulness and protect the emotional well-being and trust that are integral to the fabric of a free society.” ― James William Steven Parker"

"“The trouble with dogs (supposing you don't beat or kick them, of course) is they trust you. you're the food-giver and shelter-provider. You're the one that can fish the squeaky monkey out from beneath the couch with one of your clever five-fingered paws. You are also the love-giver. The problem with that kind of unquestioning trust is that it carries a weight of responsibility. Mostly that's okay. In our current situation it was anything but.” ― Stephen King"
"“Strength is a shield, only to be lowered by trust.” ― Tillie Cole, Deep Redemption"
"“It would have been too melodramatic, too final, to say that after this JB was forever diminished for him. But it was true that for the first time, he was able to comprehend that the people he had grown to trust might someday betray him anyway, and that as disappointing as it might be, it was inevitable as well, and that life would keep propelling him steadily forward, because for everyone who might fail him in some way, there was at least one person who never would.” ― Hanya Yanagihara, A Little Life"

"“I think [trust] is more important than love. I mean, I love all kinds of things I don't trust. Thunderstorms...white liquor...snakes. Sometimes I think I love them because I can't trust them, and how mixed up is that?” ― Suzanne Collins, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"
"“In the tapestry of life, where shadows of broken hearts dance in the twilight, the coin of security often tarnished, and the truth, a tempestuous muse, we find ourselves entwined in the sonnet of hard feelings, woven with threads of uncertainty and the delicate dance of fractured trust.” ― Omotoso Omotayo Olawande"

"“If the currency is anything other than time and consistency, trust will never be earned.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“Gentleness, which belongs to virtue, is to be carefully distinguished from the mean spirit of cowards, and the fawning assent of sycophants. It removes no just right from fear; it gives up no important truth from flattery; it is, indeed, not only consistent with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a manly spirit and a fixed principle in order to give it any real value.” ― Hugh Blair"

"“Understanding is not a question of keen intelligence; understanding is a question of deep rapport. Understanding is not a question of reason, intellect, logic. Understanding is a question of deep sympathy, or even of deep empathy; hence the central significance of trust, faith. Understanding happens through faith, because in faith you trust, in trust you become sympathetic, in trust rapport is possible -- because you are not defensive, you leave the doors open.” ― Osho, And The Flowers Showered Discourses On Zen"

"“The Dark CloudIs the green-eyed monster of jealous idiots who want your wisdom but don’t want your traumaIs the ignorance of people who have not gone through any dramaIs the incalculable resilience of survivors of war and genocide that don’t seek to destroy the lives of othersIs the difficulty associated with trusting anyone when you have lost your brothers and mothers” ― Aida Mandic, The Dark Cloud"
"“Faith is the conscious surrender that turns your despair into lessons of divine transformation.” ― Troy Hadeed, My Name Is Love: We're Not All That Different"
"“Stressful conditions tax our cognitive bandwidth, reducing our ability to think clearly and exercise executive control. Stress also hurts our ability to make rational long-term decisions that require delayed gratification. Living in a community in which we feel a sense of trust and support acts as a buffer against the detrimental impact of scarcity. However, a higher level of income inequality in our community can fray our sense of social trust.” ― Dan Ariely, Misbelief: What Makes Rational People Believe Irrational Things"
"“The light of a lamp shines on and does not lose its radiance until it is extinguished. Will then the truth, justice and self-control which fuel you fail before your own end?” ― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations"
"“But loving somebody isn't perfection and good times and laughing and making love. Love is forgiveness and patience and faith and every once in a while, it's a gut punch. That's why it's a dangerous thing, when you go loving a wrong person. When you love somebody who doesn't deserve it. You have to be with somebody that deserves your faith and you have to be deserving of somebody else's. It's sacred.” ― Taylor Jenkins Reid, Daisy Jones & The Six"
"“There were times, she would admit, when for all her heroic independence, her sacred resilience, she would have liked to trust her weight to the love of another person like that. To fall backwards in absolute security. Bu she had only known doubting love. Love that needed to be weighed against what it cost. She was exhausted. Everything was so hard.” ― Ronan Hession, Panenka"

"“The individual journey that people take down the funnel of misbelief reflects a societal journey into mistrust. No matter where you are on the political spectrum, and no matter where you are in the world (with the possible exception of Scandinavia), it is hard to escape the ways in which our society's level of trust is decreasing, with alarming consequences.” ― Dan Ariely, Misbelief: What Makes Rational People Believe Irrational Things"

I am the only man in all Gethen that has trusted you entirely, and I am the only man in Gethen that you have refused to trust.”He put his head in his hands. He said at last, “I’m sorry, Estraven.” It was both apology and admission.“The fact is,” I said, “that you’re unable, or unwilling, to believe in the fact that I believe in you.” ― Ursula K.

"“Orientarea pe locus intern de control lucrează direct cu încrederea intrapersonală a clientului și cu convingerile limitative ale acestuia.În același timp, fiecare sesiune de coaching în sine este, pentru client, un exercițiu de încredere interpersonală, adică un exercițiu de poziționare față de locusul extern de control.” ― Iulia Dobre-Trifan, Provocări și echilibru în coaching executiv pragmatic"
"“The one thing that inspires fearless devotion in followers is devotion from their leader.” ― Donna Goddard, Dance: A Spiritual Affair"
"“Trust is fragile. Yet, the forces that crush it are not. Therefore, the person who is willing to extend trust into an environment such as this must be fragile enough to understand the trust that they are giving, while strong enough to face the forces that seek to crush it. And it is this person who is not stymied by the shallowness of those who understand neither and therefore destroy both.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"
"“...when Ruthie emerges...I lie there quietly listening to her fears, her sorrows. Then I tell her good-bye, muster my strength, rise and open the door and et the sunshine in.

"“There is this magical idea of sitting underneath a seemingly endless canopy of twinkling stars and wishing upon the one that is the brightest of all.

"“Not trusting people does not make you a badperson, not trusting people prevents youfrom becoming a broken and a bad person.” ― Enoble Asuquo, Truths By Moonlight : Í kí ké"
"“Many years later, I happened to learn about planned parenthood and birth control to guard against unwanted children. I must say, Barbara, who we now had to call Johannes, had not been exactly planned for that very moment, and as far as being wanted is concerned, I would've gladly said many times, ""Oh, won't you please be so kind as to wait for just six months."" Yes, many times on the flight, on the boat, on the bus, on the stage. But thousands of years ago, God assured us – it's in the Book – ""For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor your ways My ways."" So if there's any planning to be done, why don't we let Him do it? Looking back now, I know that He chose the only right moment for Johannes' arrival.” ― Maria Augusta von Trapp, The Story of the Trapp Family Siingers"

"“Paying acolytes. How could you trust someone you paid for a service? A prostitute gave you what you wanted. A therapist gave you what you wanted. What a mistake to believe in the sanctity of memory or dreams. A man might as well believe the romantic murmurings of a call girl.” ― Melanie Finn, The Gloaming"
"“Confidence is a word born of a deeply primal wish. And it is rendered a wish simply because it is rarely a reality. We long for it. We hope for it. We engage in a myriad number of situations hoping against all hope that we can have confidence in whatever it is that we’ve chosen to engage in. Yet, the confidence that we are most often left with is the confidence that we cannot be confident. And the single exception that I have found is the God who was confident enough in me to be all things confident for me.” ― Craig D. Lounsbrough"

"“Prayer,"" she said, ""is not really about the prayer, whatever you've been praying for. It's about trust, trust in your faith, trust you are being heard, trust that you are not alone.

"“The primary lesson in the failure of the peace process and the violence of the second intifada is that there is very little reason for each side to trust the other. In peacemaking, that is not always a bad thing. It requires us to be a lot more careful. It forces us to plan for failure. And it should teach us to make much more intelligent agreements. Agreements that are based on a lack of trust or, even worse, on mistrust, can push us to ensure that we are more careful in taking risks and that we build in more mechanisms for dealing with breaches and breakdowns.” ― Gershon Baskin, In Pursuit of Peace in Israel and Palestine"
"“Safeword - facilitating instant distinctions when time is short, and risks are high.You put everything you are into that collection of letters. You give your vulnerability and control; you pledge your life to that one sound.

Fox, A Sinful Sacrifice"
"“To know I had been in control, that I might've been scared, I still knew in my right mind that I could be free with one word or action - and I didn't use it.

Trust is founded on the capability to assume accountability; however, narcissists neither possess the capacity for responsibility nor the willingness to accept it – they consistently allocate blame instead.” ― Tracy Malone"
"“You are the good part of everything, sweetie. We can’t control what people do - how they betray us or even why. How they leave our lives. So many people are running scared.

But the ones who don’t come back - or who don’t work to earn back what they lost from us - we have to let them go.” ― Hayley Kiyoko, Girls Like Girls"

'Here all are enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold!''Folly it may seem,' said Haldir. 'Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond Lothlórien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by our own trust endanger our land.

"“What did it mean to be a Christian? It did not mean to be a good person, to be more Christ-like or to get my act together. It meant the king of the universe was at the center of my life.

"“I reach for her. 'I'm so sorry I had to keep...' My words die on my tongue as she steps back, avoiding me.'Not happening.' A world of hurt flashes in those hazel eyes, and I fucking wither. 'Just because I believe you and am willing to fight with you doesn't mean I'll trust you with my heart again. and I can't be with someone I don't trust.'Something in my chest crumples. 'I've never lied to you, Violet. Not once. I never will.'She walks over to the window and looks down, then slowly turns back to me. 'It's not even that you kept this from me. I get it. It's the ease with which you did it. The ease with which I let you into my hear and didn't get the same in return.' She shakes her head, and I see it there, the love, but it's masked behind defences I foolishly forced her to build.I love her. Of course I love her. But if I tell her now, she'll think I'm doing it for all the wrong reasons, and honestly, she'd be right.I'm not going to lose the only woman I've ever fallen for without a fight. 'You're right. I kept secrets,' I admit, pressing forward again, taking step after step until I'm less than a foot from her. I palm the glass on both sides of her head, loosely caging her in, but we both know she could walk away if she wanted. But she doesn't move. 'It took me a long time to trust you, a long time to realise I fell for you.'Someone knocks, I ignore it.'Don't say that.' She lifts her chin, but I don't miss the way she glances at my mouth.'I fell for you.' I lower my head and look straight into her gorgeous eyes. She might be rightfully pissed, but she sure as Malek isn't fickle. 'And you know what? You might not trust me anymore, but you still love me.'Her lips part, but she doesn't deny it. 'I gave you my trust for free once, and once is all you get.' She masks the hurt with a quick blink. Never again. Those eyes will never reflect hurt I've inflicted ever again.'I fucked up by not telling you sooner, and I won't even try to justify my reasons. But now I'm trusting you with my life- with everyone's lives.' I've risked it all by just bringing her here instead of taking her body back to Basgiath. 'I'll tell you anything you want to know and everything you don't. I'll spend every single day of my life earning back your trust.'I'd forgotten what it felt like to be loved, really, truly, loved- it'd been so many years since Dad died. And mom... Not going there. But then Violet gave me those words, gave me her trust, her heart, and I remembered. I'll be damned if I don't fight to keep them.'And if it's not possible?''You still love me. It's possible.' Gods, do I ache to kiss her, to remind her exactly what we are together, but I won't, not until she asks. 'I'm not afraid of hard work, especially not when I know just how sweet the rewards are.. I would rather lose this entire war than live without you, and if that means I have to prove myself, over and over, then I'll do it. You gave me your heart, and I'm keeping it.'

"“Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship, but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak boldly with him as with yourself. As to yourself, although you should live in such a way that you trust your own self with nothing which you could not entrust even your enemy, yet, since certain matters occur which convention keeps secret, you should share at least all your worries and reflections. Regard him as loyal, and you will make him loyal. Some, for example, fearing to be deceived, have taught men to deceive; by their suspicions, they have given their friend the right to do wrong.” ― Seneca, Letters From A Stoic | Moral Letters To Lucilius"

"“Why would you do that to him?' I hurl at Xaden, then shake my head. I don't care why. 'Forget it,' I mutter, then march off, heading back toward the spot where Tairn told me to wait.'Because you put too much faith in him,' Xaden answers anyway, catching up to me without even lengthening his stride. 'And knowing who to trust is the only thing that will keep you alive- keep us alive- not only in the quadrant but after graduation.''There is no us,' I say, dodging a racer as she races past. Dragons land left and right, the ground trembling with the force of the riot's movement.

"“There is a profound connection between the sleep we get in our beds each night and the sacramental rest we know each Sunday in our gathered worship. Both gathered worship and our sleep habits profess our loves, our trusts, and our limits. Both involve discipline and ritual. Both require that we cease relying on our own effort and activity and lean on God for his sufficiency. Both expose our vulnerability. Both restore.” ― Tish Harrison Warren, Liturgy of the Ordinary: Sacred Practices in Everyday Life"

"“Edgar picks up the mallet. The steer comes up close to him. Edgar looks into the animal's eyes and caresses its forehead. The cow stomps one hoof, wags its tail and snorts. Edgar shushes the animal and its movements slow. There is something about this shushing that makes the cattle drowsy, it establishes a mutual trust. An intimate connection. With his thumb smeared in lime, Edgar Wilson makes the sign of the cross between the ruminant's eyes and takes two steps back.

"“Without the aid of sacred ceremony or costume, her feelings had turned this man, only a few years older than herself, into a priest, a sort of trust less rare than the fidelity that guards it. Young reverence for one who is also young is the most coercive of all: there is the same level of temptation, and the higher motive is believed in as a fuller force--not suspected to be a mere residue from weary experience.But the coercion is often stronger on the one who takes the reverence. Those who trust us educate us. And perhaps in that ideal consecration of Gwendolen's, some education was being prepared for Deronda.” ― George Eliot, Daniel Deronda"
"“And if a collection of bad cells no bigger than a walnut could destroy all those things, those things that are so personal that they can never be properly articulated, so personal you hardly dared admit their existence to yourself, what did that leave?

"“We accept the fact that being a parent requires a fundamental level of trust in the community of people around your child. If every coach is assumed to be a podophile, then no parent would ever let their child leave the house. And no sane person would ever volunteer to be a coach. We default to truth even when that decision carries terrible risks because we have no choice. Society cannot function otherwise.” ― Malcolm Gladwell, Talking To Strangers: What We Don't Know About Strangers"
"“Vulnerability is our relationship to our weaknesses, not our weaknesses themselves. It's the feeling we have when confronted with our imperfections. The image of being vulnerable is that of taking off our armor, making ourselves available to be intimate, to be touchable. To own your vulnerabilities is a move of trust, a move of solidarity.” ― Scott Erickson, Say Yes: Discover the Surprising Life Beyond the Death of a Dream"
"“My path in life in life has always been to trust myself; my path in life has always been to trust my intuition, to trust my heart, to trust the inner true voice, to trust my inner source of love, truth and wisdom, which is already in contact with the Whole. I have always listened to other people, and to what situations in life can teach me, but then I have always listened to the silent whisperings of my heart.There is always a meaning with whatever happens. It is basically a question of perspective; it is a question of seeing a situation from the perspective of the limited personality, or to see a situation from the perspective of the unlimited inner being, from the perspective of the soul. It is a question of seeing the creative potential in every situation, to see what we can learn in every situation, and to be open to see how life will solve this situation.When we see the situation from the perspective of the soul, it is like watching the situation from the summit of the mountain, instead of seeing the situation from the perspective of the personality, to see the situation from the foot of the mountain. When we see the situation from the perspective of the soul, we can also see that both good and bad situations, both positive and negative experiences, are teachers in life to learn to create a greater understanding of the Whole.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten"
"“Some years ago, I felt that Iexperienced more limitations than possibilities in a spiritual organization, which I had belonged to for a long time. It became clear for me that I was prepared to expand, and take a new step in my spiritual growth. To be spiritual does not mean to belong to a spiritual group. I felt that I had grown out of the kindergarten, and my inner tree was bearing fruit. Too many large trees cannot grow in a narrow area. This was a lesson to stand on my own feet; it was a lesson for me to live my own life, to live my own truth, without following anybody else. I do not belong to any spiritual group or tradition. I am only interested in exploring what it means to live with open eyes. This lesson developed and expanded my inner being. Many years ago, when I sat and meditated by a slow flowing river in India, it taught me that if I learnt to listen to the river, if I surrendered and became one with the river, I did not need any other teacher in meditation. This river could teach me all the mysteries of life. In the same way, everything can become a door to the secrets of life, for example a man or a woman, a tree, a bird, a stone or the blue sky, if we know how ro listen and surrender. It is such a deep joy, such a deep inner satisfaction, to feel that I belong to life, that I am one with Existence. When Buddha was lying on his deathbed, and the disciples asked him if he had any last words for them, he said: Be a light to yourself. You are born with a light within you. You are enough to yourself. You are sufficient to yourself. Listen to the still small voice within, and that will guide you. Buddha defines wisdom as living in the light of our own consciousness. Buddha's message to be a light to yourself is a message to all seekers of truth and all meditators on the path of enlightenment. You have to be silent, so that you can listen to the still small voice within you. Follow your own voice in silence, love and deep trust. You have to follow the still, small voice within you and you have to follow your being.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, Meditation: A Love Affair with the Whole - Thousand and One Flowers of Silence, Love, Joy, Truth, Freedom, Beauty and the Divine"
"“There are not many things that the different approaches of modern psychology agree about, but there is one thing that they all agree about: that people in groups and organizations, simply put, become more stupid. Individually people are more intelligent, because they have to take more responsibility. But in a group, people do not have to take the same amount of responsibility. People in groups and organizations tend to get caught up in the need of the ego to create hierarchies of power, status, positions, roles, norms and conformity.All organizations are more or less dysfunctional. The sign of a dysfunctional group is that the members of the group play three roles and positions: aggressor,denier and victim. It is always easier to follow the group without reflection or awareness, than to trust your own heart, to trust your own intelligence,truth, wisdom and creativity. It is not always easy to follow your own heart,but it always leads your right.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, Meditation: A Love Affair with the Whole - Thousand and One Flowers of Silence, Love, Joy, Truth, Freedom, Beauty and the Divine"

"“Now, at that moment, I was building trust; I was there for her. I was connecting with her rather than choosing to think only about what I wanted. There are the moments, we've discovered, that build trust.One such moment is not that important, but if you're always choosing to turn away, then trust erodes in a relationship--very gradually, very slowly.” ― Brené Brown, Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead"
"“Observe, Trust Your Gut, and Rebuild Wisely! When trust is lost, it's important not to doubt yourself when being cautious. Instead, use that experience as a tool to read behavior and motives, since people often reveal their true intentions. Inconsistency and an unwillingness to compromise can be signs to be even more cautious. The media might encourage you to have the courage to trust again, but you shouldn't be fooled twice. Instead, sit back and observe behavior and actions, and always trust your inner voice. If you don't feel like doing something, you shouldn't do it, no matter how hard it is to say no. You can't allow yourself to fall into the same trap you were in beforeObserve, Trust Your Gut, and Rebuild Wisely!” ― Mahsati Abdul"
"“What do you think, Kaarz?” Standing next to him in the recently pressurized but still-cold office annex, Teela knew she was once again being tested. Every time she was around the Old Man, he did that. She’d heard that it took awhile for him to trust you - but once he did you were golden in his eyes. It seemed that everybody worth the salt in their bodies who worked for him wanted him to feel that way. And why shouldn’t they? A missive of recommendation from Stinex, even just a line or two, was worth just about any conceivable torture one could imagine and endure. It was a ticket for the hyperlane that could lead to wealth, fame, and the most desirable thing of all: Freedom. The freedom to design what one wished, to give free rein to one’s artistic expression, to create something that might truly outlast the ages, that might -Teela realized that the Old Man was waiting patiently for an answer to his question.” ― Michael Reaves, Star Wars: Death Star"

"“He had suspected something, yes. But suspecting was not like knowing; he knew that now, if nothing else. He could write an essay on the difference between suspecting and knowing. What made it doubly cruel was the fact that he had really begun to believe that the suspicions were groundless. And even if they weren’t, what you didn’t know couldn’t hurt you. Wasn’t that right? If a man is crossing a darkened room with a deep, open hole in the middle of it, and if he passes within inches of it, he doesn’t need to know he almost fell in. There is no need for fear. Not if the lights are off.” ― Stephen King, Cujo"

"“We tend to trust others with whom we share similar values or worldviews. The shared belief in the supernatural world accesible through trance, where one interacts with watchful ancestors and spirits might be a basis upon which trust could be built. If while ritually interacting with beloved ancestors, members of both groups pledge their mutual allegiance, then rivals might become friends and trading partners. Once again, a psychological resource, trust, gives access to the material resources of trade.” ― Matt J. Rossano, Ritual in Human Evolution and Religion: Psychological and Ritual Resources"
"“You owe me two thoughts- back from when I first came here. Tell me what you're thinking.'Rhys rubbed his neck. 'You want to know why I didn't speak or see you? Because I was so convinced you'd throw me out on my ass. I just...' He dragged a hand through his hair, and huffed a laugh. 'I figured hiding was a better alternative.''Who would have thought the High Lord of the Night Court could be afraid of an illiterate human?' I purred. He grinned, nudging me with an elbow. 'That's one,' I pushed. 'Tell me another thought.'His eyes fell on my mouth. 'I'm wishing I could take back that kiss Under the Mountain.'I sometimes forgot that kiss, when he'd done it to keep Amarantha from knowing that Tamlin and I had been in the forgotten hall, tangled up together. Rhysand's kiss had been brutal, demanding, and yet... 'Why?'His gaze settled on the hand I'd painted instead, as if it were easier to face. 'Because I didn't make it pleasant for you, and I was jealous and pissed off, and I knew you hated me.'Dangerous territory, I warned myself.No. Honesty, that's what it was. Honesty, and trust. I'd never had that with anyone.Rhys looked up, meeting my gaze. And whatever as on my face- I think it might have been mirrored on his: the hunger and longing and surprise.I swallowed hard, traced another line of stardust along the inside of his powerful wrist.

You don’t need to jump into the driver’s seat before the other person has an opportunity. Love freely and genuinely. Love openly and with courage. And forgive, forgive, forgive. People are a mass of problems. Stop remembering them all, or there will be no room to create the beautiful moments you wish to cherish in your soul.” ― Donna Goddard, Circles of Separation: A Spiritual Fiction Series"

And the challenge is to to not become offended toward God, to not turn away from Him when we don't understand. In person, with all of my questions and doubts, I chose to embrace Him, to continue running after Him, to continue turning my eyes towards Him, and say, 'I don't understand. But I still love you.'

And something about that look leaned on every last one of Zaf's pressure points—not in a painful way, not exactly. More like a massage that hurt really fucking good. Maybe she wasn't family or forever, but she was a really good friend [...] one undeniable fact shone like a star: Dani didn't hurt people and she didn't make things worse. She always—always—tried to make them better. That must be why, for the first time in a long time, he wanted to keep talking more than he wanted to shut someone down. He could trust her.

Yet, after the name had been read, and a false seed of suspicion planted, the sun of their happiness dipped behind a bank of storm clouds and the light which had bathed them faded. It did not fade immediately. Nor in a way which was recognisable at the start. It faded in long silences and crossed arms, in questions which came from nowhere and were answered awkwardly for their strangeness. It faded in kisses avoided and tired sighs, then finally in absences and then all was passed into darkness, though neither knew it until a moment in which they both turned to look for what once they had loved, and found it was gone.” ― T.M Cicinski, The Mind Is Its Own Place"

Men will come to see and feel the similarity and commonality of their ways. Laws and teachings held in common compel people to solitude, so that they may escape the pressure of undesirable contact, but solitude makes people hostile and venomous. Therefore give people dignity and let each of them stand apart, so that each may find his own fellowship and love it. Power stands against power, contempt against contempt, love against love. Give humanity dignity, and trust that life will find the better way. The one eye of the Godhead is blind, the one ear of the Godhead is deaf, the order of its being is crossed by chaos.

The most fundamentallesson has to happen within yourself first. In India, where they have developed the inner science of spirituality for thousands of years, they made a basic condition that one should begin to develop trust in oneself.

Intuition is basically to develop a trust in yourself. When you trust yourself, you can trust others, you can trust existence. Love and silence are the two ways to develop intuition, to develop trust in yourself. Trust is a prerequisite for love.

The Whole is breathing and pulsating in you. When you start feeling this love and trust of the Whole, you start to grow roots in your being.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, The Call of the Heart"

"“In this world, there is only one happiness and that is to be yourself. And because nobody is himself, everybody is trying somehow to hide, with masks, with pretensions and with hypocrisy. They are being taught everything in the education system, but they are not taught to be themselves. This is what makes everybody miserable. To be what you do not want to be, to do something that you do not want to do. These things are the basis of all misery. Sooner or later, you have to decide. You have tosay: Whatever the cost, I want to be myself. Condemned, ridiculed, losing respectability, everything is ok, but I cannot pretend anymore to be somebody else. This decision and declaration of freedom, freedom fromthe weight of the crowd of people, gives back your natural being. Then you can simply be yourself just as you are.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, The Call of the Heart"

The dust temporarily settling, as though in a temporary truce, then rising, swirling and rushing David’s laboratory windows, bearing mites and putrescine and bacteria, threatening to begin its irreversible process of decay.The men watered and watered and watered.Maybe such unruly persistence is beautiful.Maybe it is not mad, after all. Maybe it is the quiet work of believing in Good. Of believing in a warmth, which you know does not exist in the stars, to exist in the hearts of fellow humans. Maybe it is something like trust.” ― Lulu Miller, Why Fish Don’t Exist: A Story of Loss, Love, and the Hidden Order of Life"

"“Conversations happen quite often in life. As a writer and a poet, I like listening rather than talking. Somehow the conversations come out quite interesting. As a writer, I don't judge anyone. Because we are all humans and nobody can be totally perfect. In fact, perfect people do not make interesting characters in stories. And invariably I like to listen to the life stories and instances of the people whom I meet in life. Most people trust me and tell me their life stories. And the people I meet shape the characters and the stories that I write.” ― Avijeet Das"

He guides us into those footholds with His strong hands while we're safely tethered to Him by a bright red rope of grace, which holds us securely. Somehow in all of this, the terrain we navigate doesn't seem as scary either, because when we're on an adventure with God we're too excited to be afraid and too engaged to be thinking of anything else.” ― Bob Goff, Love Does: Discover a Secretly Incredible Life in an Ordinary World"

Still scared.He’s not gonna believe me.He’s gonna twist it until it lines up with the way he sees the world, and then this impossible thing between us will crack and shrivel and die.There’s something worse than sneaking away and never seeing him again. It’s cowering in this room, telling him the truth, watching him weigh up the value of people and their word, and living through the exact moment when he ranks me less than.It’s keeping my head up while he breaks my heart, and I’m already wrung out and so damn tired.I don’t know where to find the strength.But I will.I’ve picked myself up off the floor before.It’s cold comfort, but it’s enough.He’s turned his back on me before.

"“For some people, the reward is the driving force behind the habit. We’ve already established that powerful neurotransmitters cause a chemical reaction to reward the ritual and increase pleasure (dopamine) and/or feelings of happiness and positive mood (serotonin). However, other neurotransmitters may also be involved, like endorphins (which reduce stress and alleviate pain) or oxytocin (which increases a sense of trust and intimacy).” ― Simon Marshall, The Brave Athlete: Calm the F*ck Down and Rise to the Occasion"
"“A different Japanese study showed that playing with a dog with which you have a strong bond—a dog that is more likely to make eye contact with you—can increase oxytocin. This suggests that having someone look to you for support or trust can increase oxytocin. Simply petting a dog can also start an upward spiral. Petting, like other forms of light touch, boosts oxytocin. And petting a dog, even someone else’s dog, also increases dopamine and endorphins. The increases in these other neurotransmitters provides even more thrust to an upward spiral.” ― Alex Korb, The Upward Spiral: Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time"

"“I started out trusting everyone and assuming they would always do the right thing when they were supposed to, despite the situation. I grew up on the golden rule. The 10 Commandments and all these morals and values about right and wrong and being truthful and loyal. Then, I was betrayed. I was hurt, talked about, lied on, shunned, condemned, shamed, embarrassed, humiliated, and left broken by so many people including those who were close to me and those I would have given my last to- those I did give my last to; all while they were taking, stealing and robbing from me financially, emotionally, physically and psychologically. So now, obviously my approach to people would be different. My perception has changed. Now, when I see people, I don’t automatically trust them. I don’t trust them at all.” ― Niedria D. Kenny"

"“I love to accompany the why to everything we do as this archetype looks for big-picture meaning. These athletes crave independence. When trust is built and the situation allows, it is OK to casually turn your back on the Free Spirit and let them be as they create, work, or put in a little extra time to hone their craft. Once the athlete is educated appropriately and has a high training age, including them on decisions regarding set and rep ranges will help this athlete take control of their training process.” ― Brett Bartholomew, Conscious Coaching: The Art and Science of Building Buy-In"

The crew wanted to succeed, but they were afraid of pouring their hearts into something that wasn’t going to succeed. You could FEEL that fear and in notes meetings everyone was so afraid of hurting someone’s feelings that they held back. We had to learn we weren’t attacking the person. We were attacking the project. Only then could we create a crucible that boils away everything that has not working and leaves the strongest framework. Earning trust takes time.

"“Trusting our instincts is not limited to sports. In every walk of life, regardless of how well trained our instincts are, we will usually do our best by trusting them. Recent brain-scanning technology has shown that the brain unconsciously makes rational decisions, quickly analyzing the data it gets, and reaches a decision sometimes seconds before our conscious minds “think up” that same decision. Actions that feel like random choices or instinctive responses are often logical thought processes using available information carried out in the unconscious mind.

Ineffective communication with coworkers, conflict on teams, or a lack of trust—all of which prevent you from focusing on the work at hand. These problems plague every industry, because every industry has people. Even the greatest organizations in the world have people problems.The funny thing is, though every organization has people problems, most don’t want to talk about them. They ignore these problems and hope they’ll go away on their own. Often it’s because they don’t know where to start.

"“The more desired relationship is one of respect and trust. If so, this change can start with a change of attitude. If you observe Self 1, in its critical posture, it looks down at Self 2 and diminishes it (in its own eyes) with its disparaging thoughts. The other possibility is to learn to look up to Self 2. This is the attitude of respect based on true recognition of its natural intelligence and capabilities. Another word for this attitude is humility, a feeling that happens naturally in the presence of something or someone you admire. As you find your way to an attitude that slopes upward toward Self 2 with respect, the feelings and thoughts that accompany the controlling and critical attitude fade and the sincerity of Self 2 emerges. With an attitude of respect, you learn to speak in the language of the respected person.” ― Timothy Gallwey"

I am guessing you probably are thinking of setting this letter down and stepping away from it, like it’s a firework about to go off in your hand.

Sometimes the public health message is dead wrong.” ― Heather E. Heying"

"“I don’t know if I’ll get in at Stanford,” one premed said to me after he had sent in his application. “Or anywhere else,” he added. Another mentioned a different school, but the students’ worries were essentially the same. I seldom got involved in what I called freaking out, but this kind of talk happened often, especially during our senior year. One time when this freaking out was going on and I didn’t enter in, one of my friends turned to me, “Carson, aren’t you worried?” “No,” I said. “I’m going to the University of Michigan Medical School.” “How can you be so sure?” “It’s real simple. My father owns the university.” “Did you hear that?” he yelled at one of the others. “Carson’s old man owns the University of Michigan.” Several students were impressed. And understandably because they came from extremely wealthy homes. Their parents owned great industries. Actually, I had been teasing, and maybe it wasn’t playing fair. As a Chrisitan, I believe that God— my Heavenly Father— not only created the universe, but He controls it. And, by extension, God owns the University of Michigan and everything else. I never did explain.” ― Ben Carson, Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story"

"“But maybe his father was right. Maybe what had happened in 1918 could never happen again. ""U.S. Reveals Detailed Flu Disaster Plans."" Cole decided to make this the topic for his research report. Plans for manufacturing and distributing vaccines and other medications. Plans to quarantine the sick and to call up extra doctors and nurses and to replace absent workers with retired workers so that businesses wouldn't have to shut down. Plans to keep public transportation and electricity and telecommunications and other vital services operating and food and water and other necessities from running out. Plans to mobilize troops (for Cole this was the only exciting part) in the event of mass panic or violence.One day he would ask Pastor Wyatt why, despite all these plans, everything had gone so wrong.""Son, that is just the thing. That is what people did not--and still do not--get. There is no way you can count on the government, even if it's a very good government. The government isn't going to save you, it isn't going to save anyone. There's no way you can count on other people in a situation like we had. People afraid of losing their lives--or, Lord knows, even just their toys--they'll panic. Even fine, decent Christian folk--you can never know for sure what they'll do next. So I say, love your neighbor, help your fellow man all you can, but don't ever count on any other human being. Count on God.""What Cole didn't know was that most of the plans he read about that night would have been sufficient only for an emergency lasting a few weeks.” ― Sigrid Nunez, Salvation City"

"“Should I trust you, Vireo?” I asked him calmly. In fairytales, the girls never ask that question. Maybe it’s because they know they will be lied to, so why ask at all. Or maybe it’s because they fear the answer will be exactly as they expect. Or maybe because they have other things on their mind like spinning straw into gold before everyone they love perishes. But I have always found you can learn as much from lies as from the truth, so I asked.” ― Sarah K.L. Wilson, Dance With The Sword"

"“Such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him. It came hard, going as it did, counter to much that was strong and dominant in his own nature; and, while he disliked it in the learning of it, unknown to himself he was learning to like it. It was a placing of his destiny in another’s hands, a shifting of the responsibilities of existence. This in itself was compensation, for it is always easier to lean upon another than to stand alone.” ― Jack London, Dutch Courage and Other Stories"

This implies fault lies with x and, as trust is generally seen as a positive character trait, is really just presenting ourselves with a little medal. A purple heart for betrayal.

"“Extreme poverty isn’t just an African issue or an Asian issue or a South American issue. It is a global issue. Before flying overseas to help relieve poverty abroad, consider the poverty in your own backyard. Every country on every continent has people impacted by poverty—whether it is relative or absolute. Bringing extreme poverty down to zero will take more trial and error, more methods, more innovation, and more communication. Most importantly, it will take more trust—the trust that people are aware of their problems and are creative enough to solve them when given the right resources. People need opportunities, connections, and education to learn more about life’s possibilities, not handouts, performative sympathy, and empty promises.” ― Danielle Hawa Tarigha, Uplift and Empower: A Guide To Understanding Extreme Poverty and Poverty Alleviation"
"“The country you live in impacts nearly every aspect of your life. From the factors I have observed, this impact can be broadly categorized into opportunities and trust. In Richland, individuals’ lives are replete with opportunity and there is little reason not to trust the institutions in their lives, yet not everything is as perfect as it seems on a mental, emotional, and cultural level. In Poorland, the daily fight for survival takes precedence over most other elements of life and trust levels are low.

But there was more to it than that, wasn’t there? Inej would never betray him. He knew it. Kaz felt ill.

What are you smiling at?” ― Leigh Bardugo, Rule of Wolves"
"“We can allow ourselves to be found by God and healed by his love through the concrete and daily practice of trust and gratitude. Trust and gratitude are the disciplines for the conversion of the elder son. By telling myself that I am not important enough to be found, I amplify my self-complaint.

"“Say YES to the life you were born to live, you are here for greatness.” ― Monika Zands"
"“Both trust and gratitude require the courage to take risks because distrust and resentment, in their need to keep their claim on me, keep warning me how dangerous it is to let go of my careful calculations and guarded predictions. At many points I have to make a leap of faith to let trust and gratitude have a chance. The leap of faith always means loving without expecting to be loved in return, giving without wanting to receive, inviting without hoping to be invited, holding without asking to be held. And every time I make a little leap, I catch a glimpse of the One who runs out to me and invites me into his joy, the joy in which I can find not only myself, but also my brothers and sisters.” ― Henri J.M. Nouwen, The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming"
"“An indescribable amount of love for my mother resides deep within my inner being. However, it is the awareness of the unconditional love she also has for me — and how she believes in me — that gave me incredible strength and confidence during many crossroads of life when nights were the darkest. Knowing that not many are fortunate to be able to say the same while truly meaning it, it makes me feel eternally grateful for our mutually trusting relationship. Not just as a mother and son; but also as friends, as humans souls sharing this fleeting life on Planet Earth. May Love, Health, and Happiness be your everyday companions. Forever and Ever.” ― Omar Cherif"
"“When we’ve been betrayed, we feel like we’ve discovered the truth about someone. But in fact all we’ve done is discover one truth about them. We’ve discovered that they can do this bad thing. Fine. Now we know. And, of course, it’s devastating.But where does that leave us? Knowing this bad truth about someone doesn’t mean that no good truth about them is possible. Not at all.

"“I see how lost the elder son is. He has become a foreigner in his own house. I know the pain of this predicament. In it, everything loses its spontaneity. Everything becomes suspect, self-conscious, calculated, and full of second-guessing. There is no longer any trust. Each little move calls for a countermove; each little remark begs for analysis; the smallest gesture has to be evaluated. This is the pathology of the darkness. I cannot forgive myself. I cannot make myself feel loved. By myself I cannot leave the land of my anger. I cannot bring myself home.” ― Henri J.M. Nouwen, The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming"

He is always good, kind, just, loving, faithful and true. Your actions and your words reflect your beliefs about God. Declare: “God, I don’t understand any of the circumstances, but I want to declare that I am absolutely loyal to You. There is nothing wrong with You; there never has been, and there never will be.

"“I have to unblock myself from this bathroom before someone thinks I’m ending it. I spend thirty minutes in the bathroom, first washing my face and then reapplying makeup, even though my hands are unsteady, and my face keeps doubling up in the mirror, with my eye movements. I know at some point. My head is still fuzzy and pounding with every move or eyelid blink I make. I was trying so hard to not think yet this popped into my mind. ‘If you don't have trust, you don't have anything. And if you don’t trust them you lose them to someone that well.’ Jenny sees me down the hall and runs to my side… Saying- ‘Come on back.

Liv is like a little girl on Ritalin when she has a sip too many and I’m antisocial and paranoid, and someone cracks a window to let out the smoke and sex stink yet know does. They're like are you nuts, it's freezing out… that was the look on their cold-hearted faces, everyone in the room is like icebergs to me, and I felt like the Titanic was about to sneak, no mercy, no compassion.

Confidence in the medical system in particular fell from 80% in 1975 to 37% in 2015. Statistics from the General Social Survey confirm this troubling trend.

"“There is a knock at the door. She feels a fear because opening the door makes her vulnerable. It could be a god or a devil, She is about to open the door but decides against it. She puts a double lock instead. Fear goes away. She feels relieved. Her mind rationalizes, “Phew! Fear proves that it was devil.”Fear comes from vulnerability of opening the door. It doesn’t tell who is at the door: a god or devil.” ― Shunya"
"“It’s very lonely and sad feeling when you are the Big Box in a relationship. You can fit them but they can’t fit you. You can understand them but they can’t understand you.The ideal relationship is when one box is just slightly bigger than the other so that they fit like a glove fits in a hand. Then there is no room for insecurities and misunderstandings. Such a match doesn’t come ready-made. Both sides have to surrender to each other to fit into each other.” ― Shunya"
"“Not just on body, we wear clothes on our mind too. Opinions and prejudices are like tightly stitched clothes. It’s OK if you wear them while dealing with the outside world. That too is not suggested for seekers.Faith and trust are like comfortable unstitched clothes. You must wear them inside home with loved ones.” ― Shunya"

"“Your entire being is like a tree. Your family and friends only touch specific parts of it - mostly the fruits, maybe some branches. A large part of you remains untouched. You feel like a machine, you feel dead inside. You shout, snap, and sulk at random things, or silently suffer. How to tell them that you want your entire being acknowledged? Or maybe you yourself have forgotten your entire being.That’s why you need a person or a deity, a mortal or immortal, who is like air, who doesn’t want anything specific from you, who touches every inch of your being, who makes you feel alive.” ― Shunya"
"“A mysterious stair was discovered in a village. Some curious people went up the stairs but never returned. Villagers concluded that monsters are sitting up there devouring anybody who climbs up.In fact, it was a stair to heaven. Nobody wanted to return from there. When one or two people returned and told the truth, villagers called them agents of monsters who were trying to lure the villagers in the name of heaven.Your mind is a powerful machine. It can serve your doubts as well as your faith. It’s up to you how you use it.” ― Shunya"

"“I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State. I have never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself. It was a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced. I suppose I felt as one may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendly man-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate. In writing to a dear friend, immediately after my arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escaped a den of hungry lions. This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and I was again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I was yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of slavery. This in itself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm. But the loneliness overcame me. There I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger; without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my own brethren--children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my sad condition. I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speaking to the wrong one, and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers, whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the ferocious beasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey. The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this--""Trust no man!"" I saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust. It was a most painful situation; and, to understand it, one must needs experience it, or imagine himself in similar circumstances. Let him be a fugitive slave in a strange land--a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders--whose inhabitants are legalized kidnappers--where he is every moment subjected to the terrible liability of being seized upon by his fellowmen, as the hideous crocodile seizes upon his prey!--I say, let him place himself in my situation--without home or friends--without money or credit--wanting shelter, and no one to give it-- wanting bread, and no money to buy it,--and at the same time let him feel that he is pursued by merciless men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do, where to go, or where to stay,--perfectly helpless both as to the means of defence and means of escape,--in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terrible gnawings of hunger,--in the midst of houses, yet having no home,--among fellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose greediness to swallow up the trembling and half-famished fugitive is only equalled by that with which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which they subsist,--I say, let him be placed in this most trying situation,--the situation in which I was placed, --then, and not till then, will he fully appreciate the hardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.” ― Frederick Douglass, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass"

"“INTIMACY, n. A relation into which fools are providentially drawn for their mutual destruction. Two Seidlitz powders, one in blue And one in white, together drew And having each a pleasant sense Of t'other powder's excellence, Forsook their jackets for the snug Enjoyment of a common mug. So close their intimacy grew One paper would have held the two. To confidences straight they fell, Less anxious each to hear than tell; Then each remorsefully confessed To all the virtues he possessed, Acknowledging he had them in So high degree it was a sin. The more they said, the more they felt Their spirits with emotion melt, Till tears of sentiment expressed Their feelings. Then they effervesced!

They might have chosen to run, to seek other ways of warming themselves, for they were both reasonably cautious children with no interest in breaking their parents' hearts.

"“When our highest priority is to always make ourselves feel good, or to always make our partner feel good, then nobody ends up feeling good. And our relationship falls apart without our even knowing it.Without conflict, there can be no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally and who is just there for the benefits. No one trusts a yes-man. If Disappointment Panda were here, he’d tell you that the pain in our relationship is necessary to cement our trust in each other and produce greater intimacy.For a relationship to be healthy, both people must be willing and able to both say no in here no. Without that negation, without that occasional rejection, boundaries break down and one person’s problems and values come to dominate the other’s. Conflict is not only normal, then; it’s Absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a healthy relationship. If two people who are close are not able to hash out their differences openly and vocally, then the relationship is based on manipulation and misrepresentation, and it will slowly become toxic.Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason that without trust, the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything. A person could tell you that she loves you, wants to be with you, I would give up everything for you, but if you don’t trust her, you get no benefit from those statements.

"“The third thing about authenticity and to create living relationships to yourself, to others and to life is to learn to trust yourself. If you trust yourself, you can trust people, you can trust in existence. But if you don't trust in yourself, then no other trust is possible. Society destroys your trust at the very roots. The society does not allow you to trust yourself. The society teaches all other kinds of trust: trust in the parents, trust in the church and trust in the state, but the basic trust in yourself is completely destroyed. The society destroys the basic trust in yourself deliberately, because a man who trusts in himself is dangerous for society. A man who trusts himself is an independent man. The society needs dependent people, who are easy to manipulate and control.This is why the society destroys the trust in yourself, because an individual who do not trust in himself is shaky and afraid and then he is controllable.

"“If one trusts solely to brave generals who love fighting, this will cause trouble. If one relies solely on those who are cautious, their frightened hearts will find it difficult to control the situation. Now the method of employing men is to use the avaricious and the stupid, the wise and the brave, and to give responsibility to each in situations that suit him. Do not charge people to do what they cannot do. Select them and give them responsibilities commensurate with their abilities. He who relies on the situation uses his men in fighting as one rolls logs or stones. now the nature of logs and stones is that one stable ground they are static; on unstable ground, they move. If square, they stop; if round, they roll.” ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War"
"“Начинът, по който ме пита дали му вярвам, сякаш моето доверие е най-важното нещо в целия му свят ме карат да се чувствам като най-специалното същество на планетата и не мисля много, преди да му отговоря. - Вярвам ти. И аз също те обичам. Целуваме се. Бавно и страстно, сякаш имаме цялото време на света. Притегля ме по-близо към себе си и аз зарявам пръсти в косата му, изолирайки всичко останало, сякаш всяко нещо извън нас и този момент е изкривена фантазия, а не реалност. После устните му се местят от моите, надолу по шията ми, по раменете ми. Притискам лице във врата му, така че да усетя аромата му и се замислям, че на света няма по-съвършено усещане. Всяка болка, всеки страх и всяка заплаха си струват момента и няма нещо, което да може да ме убеди в обратното.” ― Йоана Йорданова, Звезден мрак"

"“Thus I set off at a venture, having no resource but in the Lord's mercy and faithfulness; and, indeed, what other can we wish for? Presently my subject opened; and I know not when I have been favoured with more liberty. Why do I tell you this? Only as an instance of His goodness, to encourage you to put your strength in Him, and not to be afraid even when you feel your own weakness and insufficiency most sensibly. We are never more safe, never have more reason to expect the Lord's help, than when we are most sensible that we can do nothing without Him.” ― John Newton"
"“The Moon has no light of its own, ANY light you see coming from the Moon is simply a reflection of the higher power shining on it, which is the Sun.

I must be as the Moon, always realizing that without my Higher Power, I would have no light to reflect, I would know only darkness.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."
"“Loss of trust matters because distrust leads people to disengage from their communities, reduce commitment to their workplace and lose the degree to which they share important information with each other.

"“God is not a 'He', yet 'he' is a part of God. 'God is', any word that follows 'God is' is mostly error, and for that matter, every word that follows 'God is' is partially correct, since every word is a way of partially describing the Whole. But no one word could ever do that, or even ALL the words could never describe God. If ALL the words could never describe the experience of tasting salt, which they can't, then it is folly to think that words could ever be an accurate description of the Creator of salt. The only way to know salt is to experience it personally, and that experience will be one of a kind, it will be yours. Creation can't be put in a box, no matter how big we try to make that box, it will always be too small.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."
"“Religions mistakenly consider advise/warnings from books of wisdom to be commandments, there are no commandments, no one has ever been commanded by Creation. However, there is Love. If I saw you walking towards a cliff that you did not know was there, would it be wrong of me, in pure LOVE, to warn you? ALL of the books of wisdom are simply that and are meant for us to take from them what we understand, can use, and leave the rest, they are meant to be revisited many times. If I gave you the gift of a warm blanket during the hot summer months, the pure Joy of the gift could not be realized until the winter came. Wisdom is like that, sometimes it is looked at in the summer and so we only find the summer parts useful, but if we revisit wisdom in the winter, we'll pick up many things that were left behind on our previous visit. Religion is a tool that can help one begin Spiritual discipline. Unfortunately many begin to think of the tool of religion as their God. Like any tool, once it is no longer useful, it must be set down in order to free the hand for picking up the next useful tool. Religion as a tool is useful until it isn't. Religion as a God is a cruel and destructive thing that brings much despair.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."
"“Somewhere down the winding road that leads through the valley of Love, Wisdom and Understanding, you'll realize that you're truly ready, that you've grown so much, that fear is a fading memory because of the Faith that has taken its place. You'll know when this happens because you will find yourself fully grateful and accepting of EVERYTHING that you have ever experienced, you will feel comfortable in your skin, comfortable in silence having no need for wasteful distractions. You'll realize that you trust, and are no longer desperate for ANYTHING except to serve in the raising up of your fellow beings.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."

"“Our minds have been built by selfish genes, but they have been built to be social, trustworthy and cooperative. That is the paradox this book has tried to explain. Human beings have social instincts. They come into the world equipped with predispositions to learn how to cooperate, to discriminate the trustworthy from the treacherous, to commit themselves to be trustworthy, to earn good reputations, to exchange goods and information, and to divide labour.” ― Matt Ridley , The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation"

Don’t you trust me?” your teenage son inquires.Trust doesn’t have to be universally offered. In truth, it’s usually offered in degrees and is very topic specific. It also comes in two flavors—motiveand ability. For example, you can trust me to administer CPR if needed; I’m motivated.

Because every time you say, you’ve loved them for a longer time, they’ve become more integral to who you are. At some point, “I love you” also means “I need you” and there is nothing more terrifying than admitting that to another person who can walk out any time they like. But I owed it to him, not the love, that he’d earned himself. No, I owed him the truth and the trust because he’d offered them to me. You can love someone on your own, even if they can’t feel the same for you, but truth needs to be heard, and trust needs to be returned.” ― N.J. Lysk, The Parenting Habits of Werewolves"

"“I love how this existence works because the answers are ALWAYS given once the question is asked. The difficulty is not in getting the answers but in growing to such a point that we have the questions and the pure intent to use the answers when they come. Most don't ask very good questions, and then many who have grown to the point of asking good questions haven't yet reached the point of pure intent to use the answers that would come. So, this creation has a two fold requirement in order to receive answers: 1st ask the question, 2nd have pure intent to use the answer. Lets say that I'm going to fix a beautiful thanks giving dinner just for you, because you asked me to, but before I begin the preparation for the meal, you make a declaration of pure honesty: you say that you will never take one bite of the meal I'm about to prepare, and that no one else will get even a bite from it either, because you will destroy it and make sure that it is inedible. With this knowledge I would no longer be willing to make that meal for you because it would be wasteful, and so no Thanks Giving meal would be prepared. This is the way of questions and answers, the Creator is of pure efficiency, so if a question is asked who's answer is not purely intended to be used, then the answer will wait until the one asking has grown to the point of pure intent.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."

There isnothing that ever catches God by surprise since He knows everything (omniscient) and seeseverything. Our entire life is laid open bare before God, as was David's.

"“He would not let himself be overawed by her consequence! He was also the son of noble parents, if not of a king. ""Then-then they'll need more Dagons,"" he blurted out. ""Let me go, please. Let me serve the king.""""It is not my decision to make.""""How can you stop me if I refuse to take vows as a monk when my novitiate is ended?"" he demanded. She raised an eyebrow. ""You have already pledged yourself to enter the church, an oath spoken outside these gates.""""I had no choice!""""You spoke the words. I did not speak them for you.""""Is a vow sworn under compulsion valid?""""Did I or any other hold a sword to your throat?

We do not betroth ourselves lightly, neither to a partner in marriage-"" He winced as she paused. Her gaze was keen and unrelenting. ""-nor to the church. If a vow can be as easily broken as a feather can be snapped in two-"" She lifted a quill made from an owl feather from her table, displaying it to him. ""-then how can we any of us trust the other?"" She set down her feather. ""Our oaths are what makes us honorable people. What man or woman who has forsworn his noble lord or lady can ever be trusted again? You swore your promise to Our Lady and Lord. Do you mean to swear that oath and live outside the church for the rest of your days?""Said thus, it all sounded so much more serious. No man or woman who made a vow and then broke it was worthy of honor.” ― Kate Elliott, Prince of Dogs"

"“Shortcuts don’t work because by nature they show you don’t really care about the customer’s needs more than your own. Manipulating a customer into action is no different from manipulating a friend to get your way. True emotional generosity combines action and intention to create lasting connection.” ― Alan Philips, The Age of Ideas: Unlock Your Creative Potential"
"“In our new paradigm, your business must make people feel. The people who need to feel good about your brand are your customers, and your job is to make them happy. Customers are happy when they feel you understand their needs and are willing to sacrifice to make sure they’re met. This sacrifice can manifest itself in many forms—from working extra-hard to provide the goods or services you promised, or going above and beyond to fix something that went wrong. Whatever you do, when you meet the needs of your customers consistently and exceed their expectations with more care for their happiness than your bottom line, you become worthy of loyalty and trust. That loyalty and trust strengthens the connection that’s the bedrock of a great brand and a key component of unlocking your creative potential. That’s what it means for an organization to be emotionally generous.” ― Alan Philips"
"“The key to achieving harmony and to manifesting your creative potential is to allow the surrounding energy to take you to where you need to be at that moment in time. You must trust the energy.

"“When it came time for me to go to bed, my mother beckoned me to her, and kissed me, and whispered, ""I know I'll never have another anxious moment with my own dear laddie."" I pondered these words before I went to sleep. How could I reconcile this motherliness with the screeching fury who had pursued me around the kitchen with a whip, flogging me until she was gorged with — what? Vengeance? What was it? Once, when I was in my thirties and reading Freud for the first time, I thought I knew. I am not so sure I know now. But what I knew then was that nobody— not even my mother— was to be trusted in a strange world that showed very little of itself on the surface.” ― Robertson Davies, Fifth Business"

"“I know the solution isn't to allow myself to trust everyone in the hope that my trust will be rewarded, just as the approach of treating all situations and people with caution isn't an effective one. There is no right answer. All I can do is listen to my gut, trust in my instincts, rely on my fear, wear comfortable shows and believe in women when they tell me what they know or have seen. That's all the hope we can have.” ― Brodie Lancaster, No Way! Okay, Fine."
"“We give our all to our relationships. We give our love, pain, joy, fear, and hope. We give our body, mind, and spirit. We trust the other person with all that we are. Fighting is a small price to pay for the opportunity to give something as beautiful as a person’s whole being. The really beneficial relationships are the ones where we are deeply connected to the other. Sometimes, they tear us apart and then reform us. They can be painful and scary ventures.

"“All these women were, however, careful to distinguish *sexual commerce*, in which women view sex work as skilled labor and their chosen occupation, from *sex trafficking*, described by governments, NGOs, and activists as forced sexual labor. Key to this distinction is a labor process that depends heavily on workers' consent and the establishment of trust in relation to both the clients and the madams/bar owners who regulate the workers' labor.” ― Kimberly Kay Hoang, Dealing in Desire: Asian Ascendancy, Western Decline, and the Hidden Currencies of Global Sex Work"

"“In these pages, we keep returning to one foundational principle: providing the possibility of emotional/relational safety for our people, be they patients, children, partners, friends or strangers. We are able to make this offer when they are experiencing their own neuroception of safety, not continuously, but as the baseline to which we return after our system has adaptively moved into sympathetic arousal or dorsal withdrawal in response to inner and outer conditions.When we neuroceive safety, we humans automatically begin to open into vulnerability, and the movement of our ""inherent treatment plan"" (Sills, 2010) has a greater probability of coming forward. When we have a neuroception of threat, we adaptively tighten down at many levels, from physical tension to activation of the protective skills we have learned over a lifetime (Levine, 2010). In that state, our innate healing path will often wisely stay hidden until more favorable conditions arrive.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"
"“Depression always brings to mind the possibility that the person's SEEKING system may have been turned off ...Our mutual trust in his system's wisdom kept us from being swept away by the despair he felt. We began to ask, ""what is this depression, this one who is so still, wanting to tell us?"" Then we waited. We stayed with the one who felt dead inside, acknowledging his protective value even when though we had no cognitive awareness of who and what he was sheltering.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"
"“If we trust that our inner world knows what is needed next, one outcome isn't preferable to another. It is so easy for us to want healing to pursue a more linear path: Something arises and it would be best if we could stay with that. There can be a sense of disappointment in therapist, patient, or both if the sensation doesn't return. This might be perceived as a lack in our patient's ability to maintain contact, a reflection of our inadequacy of a therapist, or simply discomfort that the therapy feels stuck.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"
"“I have other stories just as mysterious, just as beautiful, just as sacred, but it seems good to stop here and wonder if it is possible for us to begin to let go of our expectations about the shape in which healing may arrive, to trust the treatment plan lying dormant and waiting within our people, to cultivate a gradually gathering stillness so that, in the safety of the space between, healing pathways have the possibility of revealing themselves.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"

"“A glowing green traced the movements of our limbs below the gentle surf. I imagined a scaly, bug-eyed eel with razor-sharp teeth had come from the deep to hunt for a late-night meal before realizing it was a luminescent algae emitting a subtle glow with each tread of the water. At one point, we returned to the beach to rest and came across a nest of hatching turtles making their first voyage into the water. We watched the sun gradually peek over the horizon, and I realized in this moment that I had your mother's deepest trust. Miles away from her comfort zone, she was willing to walk with me and explore the depth of a world I had grown to love. I, in turn, would need to trust her to the utmost as I stepped deeper into her world of stand-up comedy.” ― Ali Wong, Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, & Advice for Living Your Best Life"
"“I am not sure how we came to believe that we know more about what our people need than they do. A core, culturally supported assumption about their brokenness may have something to do with it, and so might our left-dominant culture and training that makes it more challenging to be present to anyone's implicit experience. Many it is equally about our inability to trust our own inner wisdom to guide us because no-one helped us listen when we were young. Without this trust, we may get frightened for our people and the process, and such feelings bring on the need to assert control ...experiment with the pause, remembering that our rupture and repair are optimal, trust will grow as we and our 'patients' stumble together into the tentative, fluid process of attunement with one another that supports the awakening of the inherent wisdom and health.” ― Bonnie Badenoch"
"“I smiled broadly. "" ...This is your body's wisdom speaking to us, sensing when it is safe to go forward, pulling back a bit when it might be too much. You and I are just getting to know one another, so I really respect the caution and protection in your inner world."" ...With visible relaxation in her body and strong eye contact, she said, ""All my life people have criticized me for being cautious. It means a lot that you like that I'm that way.""W” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"
"“There are so many valuable techniques for regulation, for exploring and integrating traumatic experience, and so on. Once we get to know these protocols, they may pull on us in ways that invite us to seize control of the therapy. The other pathway suggests that her system holds the answers and that if I can offer enough safe support, it will likely begin to speak with us. At least cognitively, I can recognize that this person's inner world contains much more information about the root causes of her upset than I do. From this perspective, I am less interested in dealing with symptoms than moving towards making room for the implicit origin to emerge so that the protective systems can take care of themselves.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"

"“When a person lies to you once all you can think is what else. What else are they hiding? What other untruths have been said?To your face, to someone else; behind your back. And how. How do you begin to clean out this room in your heart? Unearth the love? Wash the walls clean white?Undo their stench from your blood. Their stench from your skin. And how. How do you begin to detach from them. And the you in them. And the I in us.” ― Ezinne Orjiako, Nkem."
"“We're cautious. How many people do you know whose crying out is for intimacy? They want to be known. They want to be touched. But they can't make that intimate connection without being vulnerable. You have to be vulnerable in order to achieve this exchange of intimacy. And you can't be vulnerable unless you can trust the situation. And what we're learning, many of us, is the world is not trustworthy enough for you to be vulnerable to it and gain that intimacy.” ― Barry Lopez"

"“The first step is the same for all of us: put down the cigarette, or your preferred nicotine-based weapon of choice. The next step, and the one after, and the one after that, for as long as it takes for the veil of illusion to lift – and lift it will, I promise you, if you give time time – is a walk in the park, compared to your life as a smoker. Just keep on walking. Trust yourself. Trust the process. Trust anything, but the lies your nicotine addiction is telling you.” ― JF Hunter, 40-Day Companion to Quitting Smoking"

"“At moments of deep uncertainty, I find that I sometimes jump the tracks into taking control, and in those moments, if I can move back toward following, the process often finds its own feet again. All of this has gradually led me to believe that letting go of expectations about the outcome of therapy as much as possible gives the process the most room to show itself.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"
"“The more you get closer to Jesus, the more you trust Him of everything.” ― Jennifer Aquillo"
"“Even though we have been so influenced by the left hemisphere's ascendency, we also have an inherent capacity to be rooted in the relational right because we are, after all, first, last, and always beings whose embodied brains hunger for connection with others, literally shaping one another's ongoing experience in every moment.” ― Bonnie Badenoch, The Heart of Trauma: Healing the Embodied Brain in the Context of Relationships"
"“When I was a child in school, one of my teachers complained that we students always told about our achievements in the active mode (I've passed), while we always told about our failures in the passive mode (I've been failed). All of this in Spanish, of course, but it's true, that's how children speak in my country. So the good grades are due to the child's actions, while the failed grades seem to be the responsibility of the teacher.What Lorenzo Scupoli is telling us [in his book ""Spiritual Combat""] is just the opposite: whenever I do something right, it's not I who has done it, it's not my action, for God was acting through me. At most I can say that I allowed God to act through me.On the other hand, when I do something wrong (sin) I myself am the only responsible, for I didn't allow God to take control.Therefore I should trust only God and not me, for whenever I insist to take control, I do something wrong.” ― Manuel Alfonseca"
"“Trusting yourself is the opposite of trusting God. If you trust God totally (as you must) you must mistrust yourself. If you trust yourself, you are automatically mistrusting God.Faith is not enough, you also need an act of will. The act of will you need is precisely deciding to trust God fully and mistrust yourself.Modern psychology has lost its bearings when they insist that one must trust oneself.

"“Only God can be trusted with His intentions. For the rest, you gotta make it clear from the onset but even then, you cannot trust them. But then again, isn't it intentional? Can I change? These are the honest questions I ask myself as a human being.” ― DON SANTO"
"“I realised one day not so long ago, that I believe in many things, but that I do not trust any of them. I have, for the longest time, not trusted anything that I believe in. And so it dawned upon me: that belief and trust are two entirely different things. One may believe wholeheartedly without trusting for a minute. I have been like a seed in the ground: believing that the Sun is shining somewhere up there; believing that rain falls and that it probably feels really good too; believing that there is Winter and Summer, Spring and Fall... but never trusting anything that I believe in enough to break through the soil and reach my branches up towards the sky! The French have a saying from the 15'th Century: ""Fleuris là où tu es plantée"", which means, ""Bloom where you are planted"". Blooming has everything to do with trust, I have discovered, and very little to do with belief. To become anything at all, the seed must trust. And so shall I.” ― C. JoyBell C."
"“Don’t blame yourself. You believed what he told you, because you trusted him. You’re a warm, open, trusting person. And you’re trustworthy.

There has been no careful planning, no worrying over details in the matter. I have simply recognized love in me, declared it to her, and to Him, and as frankly as I could told Him I wanted His way in it. There has been no leading thus far to engagement, but the symptoms of a beautiful courtship prevail - not, perhaps, a routine one, or a 'normal' one, but a good one, nevertheless, and, withal, a deep sense that it is God-directed.” ― Elisabeth Elliot, Shadow of the Almighty: The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot"

"“Because I don’t trust people,” Pip said. “Even my mom, who I do trust, has things she doesn’t tell me, really important things, and it would be nice to have a way to find them out without her having to tell me. I’d know the stuff I need to know, but she’d still be OK. And then, with everyone else, literally everyone, I can never be sure of what they’re thinking about me, and I don’t seem to be very good at guessing what it is. So, it’d be nice to be able to just dip inside their heads, just for like two seconds, and make sure everything’s OK—just be sure that they’re not thinking some horrible thought about me that I have no clue about—and then I could trust them.

Any need to explain the sources of that fear vanished with the fear; what I was left with was, at last, acceptance of him as he was. Until then I had rejected him, refused him his own reality. He had been quite right to say that he, the only person on Gethen who trusted me, was the own Gethenian I distrusted. For he was the only one who had entirely accepted me as a human being: who had liked me personally and given me entire personal loyalty, and who therefore had demanded of me an equal degree of recognition, of acceptance.

The whole process was essentially a provision of wisdom and an affair of primitive honour that should not be minimized.

"“Research shows the negative effects of diversity on the United States. Robert Putnam of Harvard studied 41 different American communities that ranged from the extreme homogeneity of rural South Dakota to the very mixed populations of Los Angeles. He found a strong correlation between homogeneity and levels of trust, with the greatest distrust in the most diverse areas. He was unhappy with these results, and checked his findings by controlling for any other variable that might affect trust, such as poverty, age, crime rates, population densities, education, commuting time, home ownership, etc. These played some role but he was forced to conclude that “diversity per se has a major effect.”Prof. Putnam listed the following consequences of diversity:'Lower confidence in local government, local leaders and the local news media. Lower political efficacy—that is, confidence in their own influence. Lower frequency of registering to vote, but more interest and knowledge about politics and more participation in protest marches and social reform groups. Less expectation that others will cooperate to solve dilemmas of collective action (e.g., voluntary conservation to ease a water or energy shortage). Less likelihood of working on a community project. Lower likelihood of giving to charity or volunteering. Fewer close friends and confidants. Less happiness and lower perceived quality of life. More time spent watching television and more agreement that “television is my most important form of entertainment.”'Other research confirms that people in “diverse” workgroups—not only of race but also age and professional background—are less loyal to the group, more likely to resign, and generally less satisfied than people who work with people like themselves. Carpooling is less common in racially mixed neighborhoods because it means counting on your neighbors, and people trust people who are like themselves.” ― Jared Taylor, White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century"
"“In all countries ethnic diversity reduces trust. In Peruvian credit-sharing cooperatives, members default more often on loans when there is ethnic diversity among co-op members. Likewise, in Kenyan school districts, fundraising is easier in tribally homogenous areas.Dutch researchers found that immigrants to Holland were more likely to develop schizophrenia if they lived in mixed neighborhoods with Dutch people than if they lived in purely immigrant areas. Surinamese and Turks had twice the chance of getting schizophrenia if they had to deal with Dutch neighbors; for Moroccans, the likelihood quadrupled.Dora Costa of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Matthew Kahn of Tufts University analyzed 15 recent studies of the impact of diversity on social cohesion. They found that every study had “the same punch line: heterogeneity reduces civic engagement.”James Poterba of MIT has found that public spending on education falls as the percentage of elderly people without children rises. He notes, however, that the effect “is particularly large when the elderly residents and the school-age population are from different racial groups.” This unwillingness of taxpayers to fund public projects if the beneficiaries are from a different group is so consistent it has its own name—“the Florida effect”—from the fact that old, white Floridians are reluctant to pay taxes or vote for bond issues to support schools attended by blacks and Hispanics. Maine, Vermont, and West Virginia are the most racially homogeneous states, and spend the highest proportion of gross state product on public education.Most people believe charity begins with their own people. A study of begging in Moscow, for example, found that Russians are more likely to give money to fellow Russians than to Central Asians or others who do not look like them.Researchers in Australia have found that immigrants from countries racially and culturally similar to Australia—Britain, the United States, New Zealand, and South Africa—fit in and become involved in volunteer work at the same level as native-born Australians. Immigrants from non white countries volunteer at just over half that rate. At the same time, the more racially diverse the neighborhood in which immigrants live, the less likely native Australians themselves are to do volunteer work. Sydney has the most diversity of any Australian city—and also the lowest level of volunteerism. People want their efforts to benefit people like themselves.It has long been theorized that welfare programs are more generous in Europe because European countries have traditionally been more homogeneous than the United States, and that people are less resistant to paying for welfare if the beneficiaries are of the same race. Alberto Alesina and Edward Glaeser have used statistical regression techniques to conclude that about half the difference in welfare levels is explained by greater American diversity, and the other half by weaker leftist political parties.Americans are not stingy—they give more to charity than Europeans do—but they prefer to give to specific groups. Many Jews and blacks give largely or even exclusively to ethnic charities. There are no specifically white charities, but much church giving is essentially ethnic. Church congregations are usually homogeneous, which means that offerings for aid within the congregation stay within the ethnic group.” ― Jared Taylor, White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century"
"“The conclusion that race is a serious and durable social fault line is not a popular one in the social sciences. Many scholars have downplayed its importance, and have insisted that class differences are the real cause of social conflict. Political scientist Walker Connor, who has taught at Harvard, Dartmouth, and Cambridge, has sharply criticized his colleagues for ignoring ethnic loyalty, which he calls ethnonationalism. He wrote of “the school of thought called ‘nation-building’ that dominated the literature on political development, particularly in the United States after the Second World War:”'The near total disregard of ethnonationalism that characterized the school, which numbered so many leading political scientists of the time, still astonishes. Again we encounter that divorce between intellectual theory and the real world.'He explained further:'To the degree that ethnic identity is given recognition, it is apt to be as a somewhat unimportant and ephemeral nuisance that will unquestionably give way to a common identity . . . as modern communication and transportation networks link the state’s various parts more closely.'However: “There is little evidence of modern communications destroying ethnic consciousness, and much evidence of their augmenting it.”Prof. Connor came close to saying that any scholar who ignores ethnic loyalty is dishonest:'[H]e perceives those trends that he deems desirable as actually occurring, regardless of the factual situation. If the fact of ethnic nationalism is not compatible with his vision, it can thus be willed away. . . . [T]he treatment calls for total disregard or cavalier dismissal of the undesired facts.'This harsh judgment may not be unwarranted. Robert Putnam, mentioned above for his research on how racial diversity decreases trust in American neighborhoods, waited five years to publish his data. He was displeased with his findings, and worked very hard to find something other than racial diversity to explain why people in Maine and North Dakota trusted each other more than people in Los Angeles.Setting aside the reluctance academics may have for publishing data that conflict with current political ideals, Prof. Connor wrote that scholars discount racial or ethnic loyalty because of “the inherent limitations of rational inquiry into the realm of group identity.”Social scientists like to analyze political and economic interests because they are clear and rational, whereas Prof. Connor argues that rational calculations “hint not at all at the passions that motivate Kurdish, Tamil, and Tigre guerrillas or Basque, Corsican, Irish, and Palestinian terrorists.” As Chateaubriand noted in the 18th century: “Men don’t allow themselves to be killed for their interests; they allow themselves to be killed for their passions.” Prof. Connor adds that group loyalty is evoked “not through appeals to reason but through appeals to the emotions (appeals not to the mind but to the blood).”Academics do not like the unquantifiable, the emotional, the primitive—even if these things drive men harder than the practical and the rational—and are therefore inclined to downplay or even disregard them.” ― Jared Taylor, White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century"

"“Most of us have spent our whole lives being taught to believe everyone else's opinions about our bodies, rather than to believe what our own bodies are trying to tell us. For some of us, it's been so long since we listened to our bodies, we hardly know how to start understanding what they're trying to tell us, much less how to trust and believe what they're saying. To make matters worse, the more exhausted we are, the noisier the signal is, and the harder it is to hear the message.” ― Emily Nagoski, Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle"

"“Gaslighting can be subtle and unintentional, but as feminist writer Nora Samaran explains, it is particularly insidious because it undermines people's trust in their own capacities:""If you think of the power, the strength, the capacity to effect change that women who trust themselves are capable of, what we are losing when we doubt ourselves is an indomitable force for social change that is significant and therefore, to some, frightening. In other words, our capacity to know ourselves is immensely powerful.""All forms of oppression seem to have this tendency: racism, heteropatriarchy, ableism, ageism, colonization, and other systems of oppression contort people's insights, experiences, and differences into weaknesses or deny them outright. For this reason, the emergence of trust can be a powerful weapon, which is being recovered all the time through struggle.” ― Carla Bergman, Joyful Militancy: Building Thriving Resistance in Toxic Times"

Part of being trustworthy is meeting expectations and staying in line, as if you were a well-behaved woman.” ― Emily Nagoski, Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle"

"“The dwarf flew up in the air. He was as safe as if he had been in bed, though he did not feel so. As he came down, the huge velvety paws caught him as gently as a mother's arms, and set him -- right way up, too -- on the ground.

"“Intuition is basically to develop a trust in yourself. When you trust yourself, you can trust others, you can trust existence. Start trusting yourself is the fundamental lesson on the spiritual journey. Love and silence are the two ways to develop intuition, to develop trust in yourself. Start loving yourself, if you do not love yourself, who is then going to love you?Trust is only possible if you first trust yourself in yourself. The most fundamental thing has to happen within you first.In India, where they have developed the inner science of spirituality for thousands of years, they made the basic condition that one should begin to develop trust in oneself.A man or woman who trust comes to know the beauty of that the more you trust yourself, the more bloom. The more he or she trusts, the more he or she can trust life, the more he or she can trust the unknown.The more you trust, the more you can relax in your being. You know that you are cherished and supported by the whole. When you start to feel this trust and love of the whole, you start to grow roots in your being.” ― Swami Dhyan Giten"
"“The relationship, whatever form it may take now and in the future, is already in motion. It is already bringing up the right issues.

"“She is better off without me.Such is for the lady to decide, I would think.Details of the woman herself began to penetrate his thoughts. The generosity in her smile. Her gentle, open gaze. The way she had told him her secrets with trust and honesty, her compassion, and her quiet, understated courage.And before he so effectively and willfully crushed it, he recalled the glimmer of hope she had inspired in him. The hope he had stripped away before it could settle too deeply in his being.So many times, he had sensed in her a desire to push their intimacy further. He had seen the yearning in her eyes and ignored it. He had witnessed the countless times she reached for him and then held back. He had been grateful for her restraint. He had been a coward.He understood that she had known better all along. She had understood what was missing between them.Rather than having the courage to explore those feelings- instead of trusting in her and her love- he had forced her away.The truth was so clear.From the very beginning, she had belonged to him, but not as a mistress belonged to her protector.Lily was his as his soul was his. Just as he was hers.She was a part of him. He was a part of her. He could not exist without her. And if he loved her, he had to trust that she had spoken the truth when she had said she wanted him, flaws and all.He did. He did trust her.” ― Amy Sandas, The Untouchable Earl"

"“încrederea înseamnă stabilitate. Există o anumită siguranță în ceea ce-l privește pe celălalt, precum și relația dintre voi. Înseamnă că mâine comportamentul său va fi ca cel de ieri și că poți conta pe planurile pe care vi le-ați făcut împreună. Înseamnă să știi că, dacă luni ați făcut aranamente ca să mergeți undeva sâmbătă, când vine ziua de sâmbătă, voi veți fi în măsură să vă puneți planul în aplicare.

"“Our trust is core trust because it is actually trust in the core of ourselves. Built into our human personhood is a gift from the universe. This gift is an ability, an inclination to make something good, growth-fostering, or useful out of anything that happens, no matter how painful or negative it is. This is also a way of saying that the universe is ultimately friendly, helpful to and in favor of our evolving richly in love, wisdom, and healing power. Thus, nothing is fully negative, since anything can be passed through the life-trusting core of us and be transformed. As early as the Book of Genesis, this possibility was noticed by humans and the word God was used for 'core' : 'What you intended for evil, God has turned into good' (Gen. 50:20).” ― David Richo, Daring to Trust: Opening Ourselves to Real Love and Intimacy"
"“We all have two voices, perhaps, many more. Every day, if not every minute, we have to choose which one will get our attention. If we choose the higher one, our suffering will lessen and, quite often, completely disappear but it takes humility and trust. The longer we keep listening to the lower voice, the harder it is to drag ourselves away from it. Nevertheless, all it takes is one second. If we chose something else last week or yesterday or a minute ago, it doesn’t matter. We just need to make another choice right now.” ― Donna Goddard, Circles of Separation"

"“If Spiritual perfection was easy everyone would do it. The beauty of this life is that wherever you are is where you're supposed to be. As you live this experience making your best choices according to the light you've been given, it is accounted as righteousness. You are where you are and I am where I am, and I feel certain that each of us is doing the very best we can with the light we've been given. There is a huge difference between believing something and knowing it. Failing at a belief is quite normal, and failing in a knowing is not possible. We are here to make mistakes. Guilt, regret, shame, etc... Slow our Spiritual growth. The only thing that is real is God's ways, and they are beyond our scope of understanding, so all we can do is our best, and God will never ask more.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."
"“I have come to understand that there are no good days and there are no bad days, there is no loss and there is no gain, our judgments invite suffering. The scriptures say ""judge not lest ye be judged"". The fact is that the totality of this experience we call life is a precious gift. Our trouble comes when we judge it. "" ""True faith in God has been accomplished when both gain and loss bring the same degree of gratitude"". How many people could honestly thank God for a famine, or for the painful passing of a cherished loved one, or for terminal cancer, let alone for the damaged car or the stubbed toe? Until one learns to give thanks in ALL things one will suffer greatly.” ― Raymond D. Longoria Jr."

"“The major difference between trust and other tangible or intangible resources used by companies is that trust is required for any type of economic activity, whether or not a business is aware of it.

As I asserted new boundaries, I started to gravitate towards people with integrity, warmheartedness and decency.” ― Christopher Dines, Drug Addiction Recovery: The Mindful Way"

"“THE INSTRUCTION OF PTAHHOTEPPart IIIf you are one among guests At the table of one greater than you, Take what he gives as it is set before you; Look at what is before you, Don’t shoot many glances at him, Molesting him offends the ka. Don’t speak to him until he summons, One does not know what may displease; Speak when he has addressed you, Then your words will please the heart. The nobleman, when he is behind food,Behaves as his ka commands him; He will give to him whom he favors, It is the custom when night has come.It is the ka that makes his hands reach out, The great man gives to the chosen man;Thus eating is under the counsel of god, A fool is who complains of it. If you are a man of trust, Sent by one great man to another, Adhere to the nature of him who sent you. Give his message as he said it. Guard against reviling speech, Which embroils one great with another; Keep to the truth, don't exceed it, But an outburst should not be repeated. Do not malign anyone, Great or small, the ka abhors it. If you plow and there’s growth in the field, And god lets it prosper in your hand, Do not boast at your neighbors’ side, One has great respect for the silent man: Man of character is man of wealth. If he robs he is like a crocodile in court.Don’t impose on one who is childless, Neither decry nor boast of it;There is many a father who has grief, And a mother of children less content than another; It is the lonely whom god fosters, While the family man prays for a follower.If you are poor, serve a man of worth,That all your conduct may be well with the god. Do not recall if he once was poor, Don’t be arrogant toward him For knowing his former state; Respect him for what has accrued to him.For wealth does not come by itself. It is their law for him whom they love,His gain, he gathered it himself ; It is the god who makes him worthy And protects him while he sleeps. Follow your heart as long as you live,Do no more than is required,Do not shorten the time of “follow-the-heart,” Trimming its moment offends the kaDon’t waste time on daily cares Beyond providing for your household; When wealth has come, follow your heart, Wealth does no good if one is glum! If you are a man of worthAnd produce a son by the grace of god, If he is straight, takes after you, Takes good care of your possessions. Do for him all that is good, He is your son, your ka begot him, Don’t withdraw your heart from him. But an offspring can make trouble: If he strays, neglects your counsel, Disobeys all that is said, His mouth spouting evil speech, Punish him for all his talkThey hate him who crosses you, His guilt was fated in the womb; He whom they guide can not go wrong, Whom they make boatless can not cross.If you are in the antechamber, Stand and sit as fits your rankWhich was assigned you the first day. Do not trespass — you will be turned back,Keen is the face to him who enters announced, Spacious the seat of him who has been called.The antechamber has a rule, All behavior is by measure;It is the god who gives advancement, He who uses elbows is not helped.If you are among the people, Gain supporters through being trusted The trusted man who does not vent his belly’s speech, He will himself become a leader, A man of means — what is he like ? Your name is good, you are not maligned, Your body is sleek, your face benign,One praises you without your knowing. He whose heart obeys his belly Puts contempt of himself in place of love, His heart is bald, his body unanointed; The great-hearted is god-given, He who obeys his belly belongs to the enemy.” ― Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms"

"“Benjamin Franklin said, ""The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason."" I disagree. To truly believe Franklin's statement in the simple terms of the quote, not qualified in any capacity, I propose that you would actually have to be insane, particularly in the realm of extreme paranoia. For instance, to merely take a breath of air, one must have some measure of faith in the vast majority of normal circumstances. One must have the faith that there is not any invisible, odorless, & lethal substance that has gone airborne in your area. To eat or drink something prepared by others, such as at a restaurant, one must have the faith that no one has poisoned your food. You can certainly examine your food prior to eating it, but to run a countless number of tests to see if it is poisoned in a way that is undetectable by sight, scent, or taste is ridiculous on a daily basis. Regardless of your belief in God, gods, atheism, or agnosticism, to completely abstain from faith in life as we know it would make the movie ""Bubble Boy"" seem like child's play. No, Franklin misunderstands faith and in his error has put a box around reason whose exclusion of faith can't rationally exist in order to further try to justify self-determination of morality. The man who has no faith in anything is unreasonable, and the man who has no reason is incapable of faith.” ― Adam Garrett"

Let us endeavour to obtain, and increase in, a sensibleness of our great dependence, to have our eye on him alone, to mortify a self-dependent and self-righteous disposition. Man is naturally exceeding prone to exalt himself, and depend on his own power of goodness; as though from himself he must expect happiness. He is prone to have respect to enjoyments alien from God and his Spirit, as those in which happiness is to be found. But this doctrine should teach us to exalt God alone: as by trust and reliance, so by praise. Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Hath any man hope that he is converted, and sanctified, and that his mind is endowed with that true excellency and spiritual beauty? That his sins are forgiven, and he received into God’s favour, and exalted to the honour and blessedness of being his child, and an heir of eternal life? Let him give God all the glory; who alone makes him to differ from the worst of men in this world, or the most miserable of the damned in hell. Hath any man much comfort and strong hope of eternal life, let not his hope lift him up, but to dispose him the more to abase himself, to reflect on his own exceeding unworthiness of such a favour, and to exalt God alone. Is any man eminent in holiness, and abundant in good works, let him take nothing of the glory of it to himself, but ascribe it to him whose ‘workmanship we are, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.” ― Jonathan Edwards, God Glorified in Man's Dependence"

Couldn't understand how they could just... say things, give them power through spoken words. Give him power by letting him hear them. Spilling life stories through random conversation, and they didn't even have the slightest idea who he was, let alone what he might do with it all. Letting parts of their lives just spew out their mouths like it didn't matter that it all gained strength with each breath.Hemorrhaging words. All of them. Didn't they know words were power? They all seemed like intelligent people--didn't they know that voicing the things inside you, letting another know, was handing that power over, betraying yourself, and if you betrayed yourself to the wrong person....Maybe that was it--maybe none of them had ever shown another everything they had inside them and had it all turned back on them, used against them.

"“In truth, Thomas was being a faithful disciple of Jesus, who warned His disciples that “many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah!’ and they will lead many astray” (Matt. 24:5). Indeed, Jesus affirms those who believe without seeing because such belief takes great faith. But that in no way suggests we should ignore evidence when it is available, as though doing so makes us more faithful. This impulse, combined with an often uncritical biblicism, not only neglects God’s command to love him with our minds, but leads us into unnecessary divisiveness and shallow literalism that blinds us to the deeper truth of Scripture. Therefore, during this process of self-emptying, we must be aware of and honest with our uncertainties. While we should never throw around our doubt with rebellious defiance, neither should we view our genuine questions and uncertainties as liabilities. Sometimes allowing ourselves to question deeply held beliefs opens us up to discovering that we were, in fact, in error, offering us the opportunity for more faithful understanding. Other times we discover that our fears are unfounded, returning to our former beliefs without doubt, yet stronger for it.” ― Jamie Arpin-Ricci, Vulnerable Faith: Missional Living in the Radical Way of St. Patrick"
"“Detachment also involves accepting reality—the facts. It requires faith—in ourselves, in God, in other people, and in the natural order and destiny of things in this world. We believe in the rightness and appropriateness of each moment. We release our burdens and cares, and give ourselves the freedom to enjoy life in spite of our unsolved problems. We trust that all is well in spite of the conflicts. We trust that Someone greater than ourselves knows, has ordained, and cares about what is happening. We understand that this Someone can do much more to solve the problem than we can. So we try to stay out of His way and let Him do it. In time, we know that all is well because we see how the strangest (and sometimes most painful) things work out for the best and for the benefit of everyone.” ― Melody Beattie, Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself"

At the intersection, you trust that the other drivers will stop when their traffic lights are red; you trust the architects and builders when you walk into a building, the engineers when hopping onto a roller coaster, the cook when you're eating the meal prepared for you. To some extent you trust countless strangers on a daily basis.

"“Control seems preferable to what we typically think of as its opposite--chaos. But I want to suggest that the opposite of control is not chaos. It is trust, and trust is far preferable to control. We want to control because we fear the outcome of letting God be in control. We fear we won't be taken care of, won't have what we need, or will be taken advantage of. But trying to be in control is futile, because in reality there is very little that we can control.” ― Dave Samples, Messed Up Men of the Bible"

"“So, once again, I'm practicing trying to follow my own admonitions, the lessons the Hell Room has taught me: to trust myself. Keep less, use more. Be imperfect. Doing these things feels like stepping off a cliff into thin air, but it's paid off before when, after ten years, I finally took the medication; when after eighteen years, I finally opened the Hell Room door in earnest and decided to tell the world my ugly secret; and when, every single time over the last year, I made a decision to keep (what if I'm a hoarder?) or a decision to discard (what if I'm filled with regret?).

"“It is often a puzzle for foreigners why the United States has such a dismal performance when it comes to murder, guns, and mental illness, all features of American life that, when compared to most of the other wealthy countries, are so awful they do not require further documentation. You might wonder how those bad results square with America’s relatively strong performances on most social capital indices, such as trust, cooperation, and charitable philanthropy; on philanthropy, we even rate as the global number one. The truth is that those positive and negative facets are two sides of the same coin: Cooperation is very often furthered by segregating those who do not fit in. That creates some superclusters of cooperation among the quality cooperators and a fair amount of chaos and dysfunctionality elsewhere.” ― Tyler Cowen, The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream"

"“One day a boy asked his father, “What is the value of this life?” Instead of answering, the father told his son, “Take this rock and go offer it at a market, however do not accept any offer and bring the rock back to me. If anybody asks the price, raise two fingers and don’t say anything.”The boy then went to the market and a man asked,”How much is this rock? I want to put it in my garden.” The boy didn’t say anything and raised two fingers, so the man said… “$2? I’ll take it.” And the boy went home and told his father, “A man at the market wants to buy this rock for $2.” The father then said, “Son I want you to take this rock to the museum, and if you are asked the price, raise two fingers and don’t say a word.” The boy then went to the museum, and quickly a man wanted to buy the rock, The boy didn’t say anything and raised two fingers and the man said… “$200? I’ll take it.” The boy was shocked and went running home with the rock in hand, “Father a man wants to buy this rock for $200.” His father then said, “There is one last place I’d like you to offer this rock, take it to the precious stone store and show it only to the owner and don’t say a word, if he asks the price raise two fingers.” The son then went to the precious stone store and showed the rock to the owner. “Where did you find this?” The owner asked, “This is a most precious unpolished gem, one of the most valuable in the whole world, I must have it. What price would you take for it?” The boy didn’t say anything and raised two fingers to which the man replied “Two million dollars? That is a bargain, I’ll take it!” The boy not knowing what to say went breathlessly running home to his father anxiously clutching this now priceless gem, terrified that he might lose it, “Father there is a man who wants to buy this rock for two million dollars!!!” The father then said, “Son you have been carrying in your hands, one of the most precious objects of our people, it is truly priceless!” The father then said, “Son do you now know the value of your life?” To which the son replied… 'The value of my life, is much like this rock, it depends on who it is offered to. Some place a value of $2, others $200, and still others two million dollars. I must surround myself with other precious Souls who recognize the greatest value of my life, because it is my most precious possession, and I must not allow it to be under valued, it’s true value is priceless.'

"“Trust of others is in short supply for many adult survivors, as complex trauma generally involves major relational betrayal. It is, therefore, expectable (although paradoxical) that clients with these histories are predisposed to be mistrustful at the outset of therapy, precisely because of (and in proportion to) the actual trustworthiness of the therapist. When past experiences have thought hard lessons, namely, that one can least afford to trust the people who should be most trustworthy, it stands to reason that confusion about trust results. The therapist must understand and not take offense either personally or professionally and not react judgmentally or defensively. Practically speaking, this involves the therapist being prepared to patiently and empathically respond to active or passive tests or challenges to trustworthiness as legitimate and meaningful communication that deserves a respectful reply in action as well as in words.” ― Christine A. Courtois, Treatment of Complex Trauma: A Sequenced, Relationship-Based Approach"
"“The overarching principle of a therapeutic relationship is that therapists should be ever mindful of a variant of the Hippocratic oath and, to the degree possible, strive to ""do no more harm"" (Courtois, 2010). Complex trauma clients have already experienced considerable harm, much of it at the hands of other human beings. As a result of the ubiquitous processes of transference, attachment styles, and IWM [Internal working models], these clients often view the therapist's behavior and their relationship through the lens of their trauma-related negative interpersonal expectancies and unhealed emotional wounds and injuries. Therapists should not be surprised to be ""guilty until proven innocent"", not because clients with complex trauma histories are ""unfair"" or ""unreasonable"" but precisely the opposite - because the most realistic self-protective stance for them (given the fact that betrayal and harm have been more the rule than the exception) is to ""distrust first and verify"" (or to be hypervigilant) rather than to start with an expectation of safety and trustworthiness.” ― Christine A. Courtois, Treatment of Complex Trauma: A Sequenced, Relationship-Based Approach"

"“If the therapist understands and does not take mistrust as personal affront, the therapeutic relationship can evolve gradually. The client can begin to recognize that the therapist actually ""gets"" why he or she is initially skeptical, self-protective, or ""realistically paranoid"" and does not pressure the client to be a ""happy camper"" but instead works to earn trust by being honorable, reliable, and consistent. This also implies a view of the client's initial mistrust as expectable in light of the client's history - that is, as a strength rather than as a deficiency or pathology.” ― Christine A.

The Master knows that the caterpillar is not dying, and is simply transitioning (to something more). This points out that things are never over, that change is carrying us, (so often kicking and screaming), to higher states of being.I find it interesting that the caterpillar spends it's caterpillar existence crawling, (on a lone weed in the midst of an endless beautiful forest), surviving on bitter, poisonous leaves. Yet resists the changes to come.After the caterpillars ""death""... And upon the butterflie's rebirth... The butterfly lives out it's butterfly existence experiencing all of the forest's wonders, being carried by the wind, landing on beauty, and drinking sweet nectar, all the while, being shielded from harm by the caterpillar's bitter and poisonous experiences of eating the weeds.Without the struggles of the caterpillar, the butterfly could never be.It is Truly wonderful how something as simple as caterpillars and butterflies can be such amazing reminders sent to us by a Loving Eternal Creator.” ― Raymond D.

We are each of us a universe unto ourselves.To put 100 Trillion in perspective...Jeremy Harper counted from one to one million in about 3 months. He did NOTHING but count, eat, and sleep (minimal). During this time; he didn't leave his home nor even shave. And that's only one MILLION, so if you ignore the fact that pronunciation takes much, much longer on ever larger numbers (more than a minute each), counting to 100 Trillion would take more than 25 Million years.It's awe inspiring to think that 100 Trillion cells (worlds) are counting ON me also, my decisions determine (to a large degree) whether they are allowed to continue living and experiencing in this life or not.Knowing all of this, who could realistically say that there are no miracles. We each have over 100 Trillion miracles working FOR us and depending ON us each and every second of every day.So when praying, I must always keep in mind that each word is in behalf of 100 Trillion worlds.OUR Father Who Art in Heaven...” ― Raymond D.

"“Playing nice"" comes naturally when our neuroception detects safety and promotes physiological states that support social behavior. However, pro-social behavior will not occur when our neuroception misreads the environmental cues and triggers physiological states that support defensive strategies. After all, ""playing nice"" is not appropriate or adaptive behavior in dangerous or life-threatening situations. In these situations, humans - like other mammals - react with more primitive neurobiological defense systems. To create relationships, humans must subdue these defensive reactions to engage, attach, and form lasting social bonds. Humans have adaptive neurobehavioral systems for both pro-social and defensive behaviors.” ― Stephen W.
