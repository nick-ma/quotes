The gut is instinctive, but we ignore it because it causes quick flashes of reaction so deep inside that the heart and mind can easily swamp it. But it’s the gut we need to learn to listen to. It’s holds the deepest sense of what we need and will give us the quickest feeling about when something is right or wrong” ― Stephanie Brother - BIG D"

"“Kamera ina athari kubwa sana katika maisha yetu. Inaweza kuharibu taswira ya mtu mbele ya jamii, na inaweza kuharibu maisha ya mtu hali kadhalika. Wasanii wakubwa duniani hawatoki ndani bila ya kuwa nadhifu au bila ya kujipodoa. Kwa nini? Kwa sababu ya wasanii wao wa vipodozi. Wasanii wao wa vipodozi hawataki waajiri wao wawe na taswira mbaya mbele ya wateja wao ambayo ni jamii. Kuwa na taswira mbaya mbele ya jamii kunaweza kusababisha wao (wasanii wa vipodozi) pamoja na waajiri wao, wasiishi vizuri hapa duniani kama wanavyotaka. Kioo ni kitu au mtu. Kama huna uwezo wa kumiliki vipodozi, miliki kioo. Kama huna uwezo wa kumiliki kioo, miliki rafiki. Kioo (hasa kitu) hakina unafiki. Usitoke ndani bila kuridhika na taswira yako.” ― Enock Maregesi"
