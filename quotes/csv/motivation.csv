Two hours later we arrived in a small town, one of those towns with one single coffee shop and where everyone knows each other’s name.

"“Master those books you have. Read them thoroughly. Bathe in them until they saturate you. Read and reread them…digest them. Let them go into your very self. Peruse a good book several times and make notes and analyses of it. A student will find that his mental constitution is more affected by one book thoroughly mastered than by twenty books he has merely skimmed. Little learning and much pride comes from hasty reading.

"“Do Something!I was sitting on a plane after a long, tiring business trip. I was a bit grouchy and irritable because the rigorous schedule I had made for myself left me exhausted. Looking to not talk to the person next to me and simply endure the flight, I decided to open my newspaper and read about what was happening in the world. As I continued to read, it seemed that everywhere I looked there were stories of injustice, pain, suffering, and people losing hope. Finally, fueled by my tired, irritable state, I became overcome with compassion and frustration for the way things were. I got up and went to the bathroom and broke down.With tears streaming down my face, I helplessly looked to the sky and yelled to God. “God, look at this mess. Look at all this pain and suffering. Look at all this killing and hate. God, how could you let this happen? Why don’t you do something?”Just then, a quiet stillness pacified my heart. A feeling of peace I won’t ever forget engulfed my body. And, as I looked into my own eyes in the mirror, the answer to my own question came back to me… “Steve, stop asking God to do something.

"“When I was a boy of seven or eight I read a novel untitled ""Abafi"" — The Son of Aba — a Servian translation from the Hungarian of Josika, a writer of renown. The lessons it teaches are much like those of ""Ben Hur,"" and in this respect it might be viewed as anticipatory of the work of Wallace. The possibilities of will-power and self-control appealed tremendously to my vivid imagination, and I began to discipline myself. Had I a sweet cake or a juicy apple which I was dying to eat I would give it to another boy and go through the tortures of Tantalus, pained but satisfied. Had I some difficult task before me which was exhausting I would attack it again and again until it was done. So I practiced day by day from morning till night.

Pleasure also in the imagination of the story, the feeling that it could mean something. Mostly I was glad to find out that I could write at all. In writing you work toward a result you won't see for years, and can't be sure you'll ever see. It takes stamina and self-mastery and faith. It demands those things of you, then gives them back with a little extra, a surprise to keep you coming. It toughens you and clears your head. I could feel it happening.

"“There is a sense in which all cognition can be said to be motivated. One is motivated to understand the world, to be in touch with reality, to remove doubt, etc. Alternately one might say that motivation is an aspect of cognition itself. Nevertheless, motives like wanting to find the truth, not wanting to be mistaken, etc., tend to align with epistemic goals in a way that many other commitments do not. As we have begun to see, all reasoning may be inextricable from emotion. But if a person's primary motivation in holding a belief is to hue to a positive state of mind, to mitigate feelings of anxiety, embarrassment, or guilt for instance. This is precisely what we mean by phrases like ""wishful thinking"", and ""self-deception"". Such a person will of necessity be less responsive to valid chains of evidence and argument that run counter to the beliefs he is seeking to maintain. To point out non-epistemic motives in an others view of the world, therefore, is always a criticism, as it serves to cast doubt on a persons connection to the world as it is.” ― Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values"

Me and myself, my reflection and I, we are not of that ilk, we aren’t ones to comply. We aren’t ones to conform or accept that the norm is a one-size-fits-all way to simply exist for we strive to be different, incredible, unique. Not irrelevant, invisible, insignificant or meek. We strive to resist and we fight to excel, so setbacks to us are a thing to be quashed, to be quelled, to be squished, to be left in our wake as we go on our way, as we sail right on by to impossible ends, to what few dare to try. This is why – this is why – as my reflection attests, there is no time to rest. The struggle is unending … but I will give it my best.” ― Shaun Hick"

"“We mistakenly assume that bodily survival has a higher precedence than ego survival. This is simply not generally true. Ego will happily destroy the body for its own sake.

"“Many outsiders clarified that they believe Christians have a right (even an obligation) to pursue political involvement, but they disagree with our methods and our attitudes. They say we seem to be pursuing an agenda that benefits only ourselves; that we expect too much out of politics; they question whether we are motivated by our economic status rather than faith perspectives when we support conservative politics; they claim we act and say things in an unchristian manner; they wonder whether Jesus would use political power as we do; and they are concerned that we overpowered the voices of other groups.” ― David Kinnaman, unChristian: What a New Generation Really Thinks about Christianity... and Why It Matters"

"“There is only one motive for writing a novel: to be published and read. To me there is no distinction between the mystery novel and the novel, only between good books and bad books. A good book takes the reader into a new world of experience; it is an experiment. A bad book, unless the writing is inept, reinforces the intransigent attitude of the reader not to experiment with a new world. Since there are criminals and psychopaths and sociopaths in all my novels they are in a way psychological thrillers.” ― John Franklin Bardin"

It cries out loudly for employment; you can't satisfy it at first; it wants more and more; it is eager to move mountains and divert the course of rivers. It isn't content till it perspires. And then, too often, when it feels the perspiration on its brow, it wearies all of a sudden and dies, without even putting itself to the trouble of saying, ""I've had enough of this.” ― Arnold Bennett, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day"

"“Your circle matters…Maybe the frustration you feel isn’t about you at all… maybe it’s about the environment you keep. You’re an OCEAN, but you’ve been shrinking yourself into a pond… all because you’re surrounded by people who can’t swim.It’s better to have a few who celebrate your depth, your growth, your waves… than to have many who only feel safe when you make yourself small.” ― Steve Maraboli"
"“Chapter One: Faith & Tawakkul“And whosoever puts their trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.” (Qur’an 65:3)QuoteReflectionWhen I read this verse, my heart feels at ease. How many times have we carried worries, thinking we must solve everything alone? Allah promises us here that if we just place our trust in Him, He will take care of us. Dear reader, let this verse remind you today you don’t have to control everything. Hand your worries to Allah and watch how He opens doors you never imagined.” ― MEHAK TAHIR, Pearls of Islam: A Collection of Powerful Muslim Quotes for Daily Guidance and Spiritual Growth"

"“My entire life has taught me that wishes are good for nothing. I couldn't wish for my mother back. I couldn't wish for my father to be a better man. I couldn't wish for coins to save the forge. Now that I'm here in Emberfall, my wishes are just as pointless. I can't wish for Tycho to return, or for the scravers to be gone, or for anything to be easier. [...] Maybe it doesn't matter that my wishes won't come true. Maybe instead of wishing, it's time to start doing.” ― Brigid Kemmerer, Carving Shadows into Gold"

"“ROT—Return on Time—is the new ROI every entrepreneur must master.” ― Hirav Shah"
"“Life will always send us our own Goliaths. They may not come armored, but they’ll come dressed as obstacles, setbacks, betrayals, and heartbreak.Life’s giants will tower over us with intimidation, convincing us that we are too small, too weak, too unprepared.Do not quit. Do not run away.The very giants that stand in your way may be the stepping stones to your destiny. What looks like opposition is often preparation. We are strengthened by the struggle.Goliath wasn’t sent to destroy David… Goliath was sent to reveal him. Without this giant, David would have remained a shepherd boy… but because of the battle, he became a King.These Goliaths of life are not punishments… They are promotions in disguise. They are the challenges that awaken our courage, the trials that sharpen our skills, and the battles that reveal who we really are.Mindset matters… Stop telling God how big your problems are… and start telling your problems how big God is. You are designed for greatness.Don’t cower or run from the giants in your life… Face them! Don’t let them stop you in your tracks. See them for what they are… A divine invitation to rise… An opportunity to step into the greatness that has been waiting inside you all along.” ― Steve Maraboli"

Maybe at first, he’d ventured near the line, tempted by the idea of boarding a train. Then the metallic voice—“Stand back from the yellow line”—had held him back. To avoid danger, he’d decided to stay put, obeying an order that felt bigger than he was. And so, even as trains went by—slow or fast, heading for exotic places or unfulfilled dreams—he never budged. He watched them pass with equal parts curiosity and regret, continuing to obey that warning meant for moving trains, not for him.” ― Pierenrico Gottero, The Strength of Fragile Days: A Long Journey Across the Middle Lands"

"“Patience is a valuable quality, but it’s not enough to achieve anything meaningful on its own. You need belief in what you’re working toward and the consistency to take small, intentional steps every single day.Think of planting a seed. Patience gives you the strength to wait for it to grow, belief assures you that growth is possible even when you don’t see it yet, and consistent care—like watering and nurturing—ensures that it thrives. Without one of these, the seed’s potential remains unfulfilled. Patience helps you endure challenges, belief keeps you motivated during slow progress, and consistency is what turns effort into outcomes. Together, they build the foundation needed to turn possibilities into reality.” ― Abdul Wahid Sarguroh"

They hit us so much that we no longer felt the pain of the punch. There was something bigger at work protecting us, something beyond our capabilities, and that kept us alive without losing our minds.

"“I have a shameful confession to make: Secretly, I am not lazy. I’ve learned that if I do literally nothing for more than a year, two at most, I start to get depressed. I’m not recanting my old manifesto. I still hope to make it to my grave without ever getting a job job — showing up for eight or more hours a day to a place with fluorescent lighting where I’m expected to feign bushido devotion to a company that could fire me tomorrow and someone’s allowed to yell at you but you’re not allowed to yell back.But once I become genuinely engaged in a project, I can become fanatically absorbed, spending hundreds of hours on it, no matter how useless and unremunerative. As a teacher, I edit my students’ writing with a nit-picking precision and big-picture ambition they may likely never experience again. And I don’t believe most people are lazy. They would love to be fully, deeply engaged in something worthwhile, something that actually mattered, instead of forfeiting their limited hours on Earth to make a little more money for men they’d rather throw fruit at as they pass by in tumbrels.It’s no coincidence that so many social movements arose during the enforced idleness of quarantine. One important function of jobs is to keep you too preoccupied and tired to do anything else.

"“Beloved, our tolerance, prohibitions, and enforcements are the silent instructors through which we impart the profound lessons of respect. They are the unseen pedagogues that shape the boundaries of reverence, molding the sacred space in which honor resides. In the permissive expanse of what we allow, we etch the contours of esteem's terrain. Each indulgence scripts the depths to which regard may traverse. Conversely, in the fertile void of our prohibitions, we plant the seeds of deference. What we forbid inscribes the hallowed ground where veneration takes root and flourishes. Yet we chisel the definitive form of respect through the decisive hand of enforcement. Each exercised injunction is a chisel's strike, gradually giving rise to respect's exquisite visage. Thus, the triadic praxis of tolerance, prohibition, and enforcement weaves the intricate tapestry upon which the symphony of regard eternally echoes. Through this debate, we endlessly sculpt the sacred ethos of honor to which we all inescapably bow.” ― Bishop W.F. Houston Jr."

"“GODMAN QUOTES 1*** Born a God ***It’s a sign of laxity waiting for the future to come to be a hope to stay.Depend in what you can do to give what you can offer.If you rest in your trouble your peace is in trouble.The idea of a great thinker comes in thinking about the impossible.You can’t rebuke a bluff when you are taken in jokes.Your best is in the bluffs that snitch your glory.A value of anything is what you have accepted it to be.Because of troubles don’t run from problems.Better days will come but the best time is unknown.If you believe in yourself also believe in your worse.” ― Godman Tochukwu Sabastine"

"“GODMAN QUOTES 7***Offence***Whom you treat worse than you treat yourself will be offended with you.When an equal is not shared equal without prejudice, offence may come to stay.It’s an offence to be offended without offence…mood desires control.To make amend of the spoil, make a spoil of what is bad, and make the wrong right.In disappointment, face what you count as the worse of your dismay.No matter the fear of losing never accept the worse you could have made better.It will bite hard to accept, your mistake is your shortfall.If you treat your weakest point you have improved for the better.What causes trouble is what separates the bond.Without the unity to be one you are separate in your ways.” ― Godman Tochukwu Sabastine"

"“GODMAN QUOTES 10***Words to remember ***What is not as long as a Key will not be long enough for a Padlock.Determination unlocks achievement.Trace all flow to a source, all bitters, tastes from origin.What is done in harmony doesn’t bear clusters.The sweetest water is tasteless in a sip.Beware… the area of time is not in measurable dimension.Whatever that didn’t allow you to work will never grant you the mercy for a pay…it’s a dividend of duty and time.A daint on your knee is not by kneeling, but an observation we got when we are faint begging our fate to the floor.We beat live where it stops others we challenge destinies where it dumps lives.Judge him not by his yesterday that was him testing the future.” ― Godman Tochukwu Sabastine"
"“GODMAN QUOTES 11*** Don’t forget ***Making a meal of things in time of needs shifts the blame of all to a mourn.Some bridges are built not for a cross, some are lengthy with trouble, some are net to a simple cross.The path of life is a pave for a clinch to the end.Our words are heavy to no learned difficult to bad listeners dynamic to less in understanding but rational to a wise mind.We keep all effort in the lock of determination and time.Tapping from the beauty of our work in good season is our reason to choice of great words.Do not forget the reason you never forget to stop.To end it well, be willing to do it better.In the little you overlook is the much you lose.Every fact of the truth you live in is a sacrifice of the fact you never knew.” ― Godman Tochukwu Sabastine"

"“A recovery friend of mine once belonged to an AA group called “What’s Your Motivation?” She said she’d always ask herself that in situations where she had to say or do something she might regret, and she’d ask others as well. She asked me that once or twice. So, you start out by asking yourself that question when the situation arises, and a lot of time you realize there is no good motive behind the thing you want to do or say, so you don’t say it. You don’t do it. After a while, it becomes second nature.Unfortunately, however, so many people out there are living their lives while untreated for their afflictions. Whether it’s addiction, including alcoholism, or a type of personality disorder, their behavior often stems from how they feel about themselves based on other people’s words and actions, things they had inadvertently taken on and clung to fiercely. They may have a desperate need for attention, validation, admiration, and respect. Maybe their delusions distort their perception of themselves and how others view them. They are so busy worrying about themselves that they are often oblivious to their motives and may not realize how little regard they have for others. In a genuine sense, they are fighting for themselves, but they’re not winning.Many of us have lived that way once upon a time and, because of it, spent a copious amount of energy on damage control. Knowing we said something we shouldn’t have said or did something we shouldn’t have done and going into this anxiety-ridden desperation to save our “image”—an image that likely isn’t real but a delusion. When we should be more concerned about apologizing or making amends, we’re more obsessed with not wanting to be seen in a negative light and having to act in order to change the negative perception.It takes recovery, healing, and time to learn that if you are intent on doing the right thing, doing right by people, and having everyone’s best interests at heart, you’ll know how to react and respond to things. And if you ever say or do something you regret, you simply say you were wrong and apologize.Empathy for others and for ourselves is what makes it possible. It makes us care about how we treat people and the effect it’s having on not only them but on our lives and the lives of anyone who cares about us. We eventually understand that how we treat people is just as important as catering to our own needs.I think it’s important to understand what made us a certain way in life and to acknowledge that, but then we have to fix it. It becomes our job and responsibility to heal that so that we grow and change. Too many people never get to a point where they can see it, let alone understand it, so those of us who do are quite fortunate.” ― D.K. Sanz"
