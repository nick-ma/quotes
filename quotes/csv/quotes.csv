Indeed, we could enjoy the present intentions. But we're in a state of oblivion, shunned from the view of fate in this period.We envision our problems gone; with collisions exposed and pawned.Oh! We could enjoy this peaceful time, on this hill, watching the sunrise.But we're in a state of oblivion, shunned from the view of fate in this period.The beautiful birds stride pass our face.Thick cuticles blurred, striped by hours of grace.They flap their wings, forming art; tail lamps for us, bleeding hearts.But we're in a state of oblivion, shunned from the view of fate in this period.People of different cultures come to us.Simple, they offer their services; no Judas.Wave their hands with care; give their food to share.But we're in a state of oblivion, shunned from the view of fate in this period.What a sad case this is; our mindfulness is butchered.Heads are swimming inbetween the past and the future.Opportunities to love others in truth are being missed.Communities could share love so true; limiting the rifts.But we're in a state of oblivion, shunned from the view of fate in this period.” ― Mitta Xinindlu"

And by the time we realize it, the peace we once had is already gone. You know love isn’t always about getting more, sometimes it’s about knowing when to stop asking. Because “enough” is never less, we just don't see its worth until it slips away.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.” ― Joe Hill"
"“She'd been crazy to consider it even for a moment. It was time to wrap things up to do what she'd come to do, to remember who she was. A freelance agent, a woman with no qualms about stealing or killing to complete a job. A cool and efficient thief who could take pride in a career with no misses. Ada Wong always walked away with the goods and it would take more than a few hours with one blue-eyed cop to make her forget it.” ― S.D.

They visit in silence, in the middle of the night, when the world is asleep but the heart is awake. I know our memories will never truly leave me; they will walk with me through every phase of life, not as pain anymore, but as a reminder of what love once felt like, and of what will never return the same way again. Some connections end, but the feelings they create… they stay, living softly inside us forever.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“You never say anything when it actually matters. You stay silent when words could have saved something, and when you finally do something, it’s always too late.

Because by the time you finally care, there’s nothing left to care about.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"

"“I lit the fire within — and suddenly, the cold outside lost its grip.When I warmed my own soul, I stopped begging for borrowed heat.” ― Srinivas Mishra"
"“I don’t feel the need to argue now. Not because I am wrong, but because I have finally understood what is peace. I have reached that stage where proving myself to others is less important than protecting my mind. When someone misunderstands me, I don’t fight anymore. I just step back, stay quiet, and let time show the truth because some battles drain us more than they teach us and I choose to save my energy for those who understand me.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“It scares me to think how bad my life would have been if I would have still been with you. When I was with you, I was losing my peace, my smile, my confidence without even realising it. And that’s why without you, I feel a sense of relief. But when I look back now, it hurts to realise how much I was ready to tolerate for someone who was never good for me, even when they kept using me.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Yes, I fail at missing you… but don’t mistake that for love, because that’s just out of habit. The truth is, I don’t even want to remember you anymore. Not your face, not your voice, not the version of me that tolerated you. You were a chapter that felt right, but it was a disaster. But now that I’ve grown, I’ve changed, I know the reality… I see you for who you are. So if forgetting you is slow, that’s fine. One day, even your memory will realise it is no longer welcome here.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Forgiving someone who fooled you is one of the hardest things. Especially when it’s someone you truly respected. You keep fighting between anger and empathy between hurting them back and understanding that we all make mistakes. But forgiveness isn’t about them. It’s about freeing yourself. It’s a long, emotional loop where some days you will hate them and some days you will understand them.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Some truths hit slow. Some goodbyes hurt longer. Some wounds never fully heal. Some conversations stay unfinished. Some thoughts stay thoughts. Some relationships hurt more than they heal… and we wait for closure that never comes. But this is life in its purest form, messy, unpredictable, and brutally honest. And this is how life teaches us that we don’t get to control how people love us, how they leave, or how they change. All we can control is how we heal after the hurt and how we rise after the fall.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“This is my life homie you decide yours” ― Kanye West"
"“Between Empathy and Compassion lies the toughest and the longest road you will ever take. Patience and calmness are two key resources which make the journey possible.” ― Ramesh Sood"
"“You know, I used to feel proud after every argument. I used to think winning a fight meant I was strong. I used to think being right all the time would make me happy. But now I understand… every time you try to prove someone close to you wrong, you don’t win respect, you lose it. You don’t become stronger, you just become someone others want to avoid. Because sometimes it's about losing the argument, but winning the relationship.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"

"“Life becomes peaceful when you understand that your feelings belong to you, not to anyone else. People may hurt you, disappoint you, or leave you, but how long you stay affected is your choice. The moment you stop expecting others to handle your emotions, you start gaining control over your peace. In relationships, this truth saves you from a lot of pain. Because when your happiness depends only on others, you lose yourself. But when it comes from within, no one can take it away.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Trust people until they show you why you shouldn’t trust them. Don’t assume everyone will hurt you, but don’t ignore the signs when they do. Watch how they treat you when you have nothing to offer, that’s where truth hides. Protect your heart from pain, but don’t let fear stop you from feeling. A closed heart keeps you safe, but it also keeps you lonely. So trust but not blindly. Be cautious, but not closed.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“I will smile again, that’s for sure. But I will never forget the nights I cried because of you, the nights I waited for a message that never came, the nights I questioned my worth for someone who didn’t care. Those nights broke me in ways no one saw, but they also made me stronger in ways you will never understand. I will smile again, and when I do, it will hurt you because you will realize the person you once took for granted learned to live better without you.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“There is something between us that is still there and I know it will always be there.. You know the worst thing is, we both feel it even today but we behave like nothing ever happened. We talk like strangers, we have moved on like adults, but somewhere inside, we still carry pieces of each other... with unsaid love.. And it hurts to know that our connection survived… but we didn’t.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“I feel what I feel… and I refuse to apologize for it. My heart has its reasons, my soul has its battles, and my truth is mine alone. If that makes you uncomfortable, I can’t help it. If you can’t handle it, stay out of my life.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"

"“Our minds are there to make our dreams a reality. Our imagination is there to make our dreams.” ― Matthew D. Devitt"
"“I agree with you because I don’t want to argue or fight, not because you are right. Sometimes peace feels more important than proving a point. I have learned that not every truth needs to be spoken, not every misunderstanding needs to be cleared. Some people only listen to reply, not to understand. So I stay quiet, not out of weakness, but out of wisdom. Because I have realized that keeping my peace is worth more than winning any argument.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Silence may avoid fights, but it builds walls. At first, it feels like peace, no arguments, no tension. But slowly, that silence turns into distance. You stop explaining, they stop asking, and one day, there’s nothing left to say at all. The connection fades, not because of anger, but because both hearts stopped trying. Sometimes, silence doesn’t protect a relationship; it ends it quietly. So talk, even when it’s hard. Because honest words heal more than unspoken ones ever will.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“It’s been a while since me and you have fought each other, Ji. What’s say we spar, and then I can show you why I’m talking trash.” ― Matthew D. Devitt, The Quest for Freedom"

"“I’LL SHOW YOU WHY I WAS FEARED!” ― Matthew D. Devitt, The Quest for Freedom"
"“You praising someone is something I’ve only ever heard a few times, but for you to call someone terrifying… They must be a real monster.” ― Matthew D. Devitt, The Quest for Freedom"
"“Thank you for breaking my heart. Thank you for breaking my trust. Thank you for making me feel unworthy of you. Yes, it hurts… but at least I don’t have to waste my time on someone so selfish anymore. At least now I know I’m not with someone who doesn’t treat me right.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“The real heartbreak isn’t loud, it’s quiet. It’s when silence takes over everything. When two people who once talked for hours now don’t even know what to say. No anger, no closure, no fights, just a strange distance that can’t be seen but is deeply felt. You still care, but the words don’t come anymore. You still think of them, but the bond feels lost. That’s the kind of heartbreak that hurts the most when love doesn’t end with a goodbye, it just fades into silence.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Love doesn’t really end with fights, it ends with silence. Fights still mean there’s care, there’s effort, there’s something to save. But silence means giving up. When two people stop talking, everything slowly fades, the connection, the warmth, the understanding. Not communicating with someone you love leaves a wound that never fully heals. You move on, but a part of you always remembers how silence replaced words, and how love turned into distance without saying a thing.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“You move on, you smile, you start living again… people think you are over it, and maybe you are. But somewhere inside, in those quiet moments, you still wish they feel the same pain one day, the kind of pain they gave you, the one that didn’t even let you breathe properly.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Tu agar laut nhi aaya toh kya haasilAgar tu mera hota,toh kabhi jaata hi nahi” ― Wajid Shaikh , Sukoon"
"“Sometimes it’s not about revenge, not even about seeing them hurt. It’s just that deep inside, you wish they feel it once, the same pain, the same emptiness, the same sleepless nights they left you with.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"

"“Ultimately, the person you become is the result of your own choices—no one else can shape that destiny but you.” ― Chris Mentillo,"
"“Our most profound breakthroughs often arrive when we’re not actively seeking them.” ― Chris Mentillo"
"“Communication is not just about talking, it’s about understanding, listening, and making the other person feel heard. It’s the lifeline of every relationship, the bridge that keeps two hearts connected. Without it, small misunderstandings turn into distance, and silence starts to replace love. People don’t stop loving each other overnight; they just stop feeling understood. That’s how even the strongest bonds slowly fade, not because love ended, but because communication did. So, talk before it’s too late. Listen before they stop trying. Because once silence takes over, words can’t fix what’s already broken.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Jump”. I do, and he catches me. Like he always does.” ― Vanessa Linhares, Peyton"
"“Relationships don’t fall apart in a day, they fade slowly, almost quietly. It starts when effort turns into assumption, when conversations become shorter, and care feels routine. Love alone is never enough, it needs patience, communication, and small acts of effort every single day. The truth is, distance doesn’t always begin with fights, it begins with silence, with “maybe tomorrow.” And before we even notice, the bond that once felt unbreakable starts to feel distant. Because every relationship survives on effort, not emotion.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“I will move on someday, but I will never forget how much you made me cry, not because I am still stuck on you, but because those tears taught me who you truly were. You showed me how love can feel worse than hatred, how silence can hurt more than words, and how care can turn into control. One day, my heart will stop aching, but the memory of how you treated me will always stay. And that’s not bitterness, that’s awareness because you were a lesson, not a loss.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“You think your silence means peace, but to me, it feels like a distance I never chose. You call it space, I call it disappearing. You call it calm, I call it coldness. Silence doesn’t always heal, it sometimes kills what words could have saved. And maybe one day, you will realize that ignoring someone who cared was never peace, it was a slow destruction of a beautiful relationship.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“I know you said it in anger, but deep down, I know it was the truth.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"

"“Your problem is that you've gotten lazy and complacent! You put your life on the line, training every day to reach the top, and when you got there, you forgot how to climb, you forgot the struggle, the burn, the grind.

"“You know, insecure people often put the burden of fixing their pain on others, especially the ones they love. I will be honest, I did this too. I thought someone’s presence could heal what was broken inside me. But I eventually realized that no one can fix what’s broken within you. And depending on others only makes you weaker, emptier, and lost. You slowly forget yourself while trying to hold on to them. So don’t do that. Your insecurities are your responsibility. Learn from them, grow through them, don’t pass them on. Because the moment you depend on someone for your peace, you lose yourself.” ― Garima Soni"
"“I don’t talk much anymore, not because I have nothing to say, but because I know you will blame me. Every word turns into an argument, every feeling becomes my fault. So I stay quiet not out of peace, but out of exhaustion. It’s easier to stay silent than to be misunderstood again and again. Silence becomes a shield when words no longer feel safe. And that’s when you realize sometimes it’s not that people stop talking, they just stop feeling heard.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“I will remember how you ignored me when I needed you the most. How you avoided my calls, my messages, my silence as if my pain was too heavy for you to notice. I won’t hold a grudge, but I will remember the emptiness your absence created because that’s when I learned who truly cares and who only stays when it’s easy. Some lessons don’t come with anger, they come with distance. And this one taught me never to expect presence from those who disappear when it matters most.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“But what about rule number one,"" I can't help but breathe, and all he does is smile. ""Fuck the rules, Tink."" Then his mouth is on mine, robbing me of any response, and I am both his wife, and a slut for the boy who is my crush, so who am I to not kiss him back?” ― G.N. Wright, The Puck Decoy"

"“I think I need a bigger mouth. More alcohol would fit in it.” ― Penelope Douglas, Nightfall"
"“Love isn’t everything, it’s just one part of everything you deserve. You deserve respect, peace, honesty, support, and understanding, too. Love without these things feels heavy and incomplete. Real happiness comes when love adds to your life, not when it becomes the only reason you live.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Yes, I felt like telling you the truth, but I couldn’t gather the courage. Not because I wanted to hide, but because I was scared, scared of losing you, scared of being misunderstood. I know it was my fault, and I will take that. But my intentions were never wrong. Everything I did came from a place of care, not selfishness. Sometimes we make mistakes not out of a bad heart, but out of fear. And that fear costs us the people we never wanted to lose.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Boredom may look harmless, but it quietly pulls you into things you don’t even need. It makes you scroll endlessly, text people you have moved on from, or chase excitement in places that drain your peace. When the mind has nothing meaningful to hold on to, it starts searching for chaos, just to feel something. That’s why boredom is dangerous, it doesn’t come alone. It brings temptation, confusion, and regret with it.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Yes, I know I am not perfect. I make mistakes, I overthink, and I overreact, too, but at least I am not like you. At least I don’t use people and then throw them out of my life when I am done. I don’t pretend to care just to fill my empty moments. When I give my time, I mean it. When I care, I genuinely do. I don’t treat people like options or memories that can be erased when they no longer serve me. Maybe I would have hurt you, but who doesn't hurt? Have you not hurt me ever?” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"

"“The day I start revealing your truth, you will have nowhere to go. Because deep down, you know what you have done, how you twisted things, how you made me look wrong just to save your image. And I still kept trying to convince you that we should clear the misunderstanding, not because I was weak, but because I thought you had some grace and some respect for what we had. But now I am not going to consider anything, now if I decide to speak, the truth will be louder than all the lies ever told. And that day, your mask will fall, and your ugly reality will be known to everyone.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“Some relationships don’t break you all at once they slowly take away your peace and energy. You start feeling tired, even when nothing big has happened. That’s how you know something is wrong. Love should make you feel calm and safe, not confused and restless. If you always have to explain yourself or fight to be understood, that’s not love, that’s pain. It’s hard to accept, but some people love in ways that hurt. Walking away from that doesn’t make you selfish, it makes you wise because peace is the kind of love you truly deserve.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“The pain of silence is heavier than the pain of truth. Truth may hurt for a while, but silence hurts every day. It leaves you guessing, overthinking, and carrying questions that never find answers. When someone chooses silence, it creates distance, confusion, and doubt. You start wondering what went wrong, and that ache slowly grows inside you. Honesty may be hard, but it brings clarity. Silence only leaves emptiness. So choose truth, even if it shakes you for a moment, because silence breaks you slowly, without saying a word.” ― Garima Soni, Life Simplified: Quote - Unquote"
"“I don’t even care about your existence anymore, forget about what you think about me...That’s how far things have gone. It’s not hate, it’s just peace after too much pain.

"“I don’t get it. Why am I not important to you now? How do people just stop caring like that? One day I was someone you couldn’t stop talking to, and now, it feels like I never even mattered. It’s strange I still think about you, still miss you, but you don’t. You just moved on, quietly, like I was never a part of your story. And I keep asking myself why. What changed? Was I too much?

"“I don’t know what more I could have done for you. Maybe I cared too much, maybe I stayed too long, maybe I kept trying when there was nothing left to fix.

But maybe that’s the truth about some people, no matter how much you give, they only remember what you couldn’t. So now I don’t question what more I could have done.

"“The R6 Resilience Change Management Framework is a cyclical framework that consists of six iterative puzzle pieces:1. Review the Macro/Micro Changes: This iteration emphasizes the importance of scanning (mostly) the external environment to identify emerging trends, disruptions, and opportunities. By understanding the broader context in which the organization operates, leaders can anticipate future challenges and proactively adapt their strategies. There should never be a time in the organizations existence where it stops reviewing the macro changes. There are times, though, when micro changes (internal) are where the focus needs to be.2. Reassess the Business’ Capabilities in the Context of Macro Changes: This iteration is fundamentally about “who are we, and how can we really add value?” It also involves a critical evaluation of the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in light of the identified macro changes. This reassessment helps to identify areas where the organization needs to adapt or transform its capabilities to remain competitive. This iteration is largely inward-looking, focused on the organization. But it tempered with the idea that “how do our capabilities allow us to add value to our customers lives (existing or new).”3. Redefine Target Market(s) Based on Reassessment of Capabilities: This iteration focuses on aligning the organization's target markets with the evolving needs and preferences of customers, the changing competitive landscape, and the new reality of the businesses capabilities. This may involve identifying new customer segments, developing personalized offerings, creating seamless omnichannel experiences, or approaching the same target market in new ways (offering them new kinds of value, or the same kind of value in new ways).4. Redirect Capabilities Toward Redefined Target Market: This iteration involves realigning the organization's resources, processes, and strategies to effectively serve the redefined target markets. This may require investments in new technologies, optimization of supply chains, or the development of innovative products and services. 5. Restructure the Organization: This iteration focuses on adapting the organization's structure, culture, and talent to support the desired changes. This may involve creating agile teams, fostering a culture of innovation, or empowering employees to make decisions through new policies. 6. Repeat in Perpetuity – or – Render Paradigm Shift [R6-RPS]: This iteration underscores the importance of continuous monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation. The R6 framework is not a one-time process in response to a change event, but an iterative cycle that enables organizations to remain agile and resilient in the face of ongoing change. Additionally, there are times when before repeating the cycle, a business may want/need to render an external paradigm shift by introducing a product or service or way of doing things that fundamentally changes the market – fundamentally changes the value exchange between customers, employees and organizations.” ― Hendrith Vanlon Smith Jr., GAME CHANGR6: An Executives Guide to Dominating Change, by applying the R6 Resilience Change Management Framework"

He has muscles that are starting to become noticeable through his clothes, and he loves to run. He once signed to me that it helps clear his head.Sometimes, we run together. We’ll listen to the same song—usually Taylor Swift if I choose, or Bad Omens if he does—then we’ll sit by the lake and watch the sunrise before we go home and get ready for school.All my friends want to kiss him. He’s the quiet, mysterious Malachi Vize that everyone wants a piece of. It sickens me—especially when they go into detail in the group chat about things I’d rather not read.

It should be abolished from the f*cking dictionary. Actions do speak louder than words, and if she’s as sorry as she makes out in her voicemails, then why does she sometimes look happy? Why is she going out partying with her friends? Kissing guys who—shockingly—vanish days later? Why does she dance around her apartment, singing ridiculous songs about love? Why is she living her life without me? If the b*tch is sorry, then why is she only looking me up on the internet and not hunting for me? Why isn’t she looking for me? It f*cking irks me that she didn’t visit me, not once. I refused any and all visitation from others, but I asked her to come and see me. I wrote to her the first two years, waiting patiently for a written reply, a presence, a smile to my f*cking face that never came. She left me in there to rot. Well, little sister, no need to look for me anymore. I’m right here, and I intend to stick around until I’ve broken you.” ― Leigh Rivers, Little Stranger"

With some regret, the river moved on but kept thinking about our stories as it sloshed and trickles back to life.Soon the fuscus, prompted by the river's resumption of its duties, began to wave back and forth once again, shaking off the droplets the river splashed on its stalks.The trees around us, taking note of their part in the story, twitched their noir leaves as the wind spurred them on, and a rustling like bells filled my ears.The clouds, always the last to hear about anything, understood that they too had to move on. So, they scooched along and let the sun have a turn.We didn't say anything. Didn't move. We simply lay on the brown grass and the black soil as we stared up at the sky, watching the clouds billow past the daffodil sun, our hands, still nested together, keeping us tethered to our reality.” ― K.R.
