Travel past them because they don't understand who they have become and never will. These type of people feel justified in revenge and will never learn mercy or forgiveness because they live by comparison. They are the people that don't care about anyone, other than who is making them feel confident. They don’t understand that their deity is not rejoicing with them because of their actions, rather he is trying to free them from their insecurities, by softening their heart. They rather put out your light than find their own. They don't have the ability to see beyond the false sense of happiness they get from destroying others. You know what happiness is and it isn’t this. Don’t see their success as their deliverance. It is a mask of vindication which has no audience, other than their own kind. They have joined countless others that call themselves “survivors”. They believe that they are entitled to win because life didn’t go as planned for them. You are not like them. You were not meant to stay in hell and follow their belief system. You were bound for greatness. You were born to help them by leading. Rise up and be the light home. You were given the gift to see the truth. They will have an army of people that are like them and you are going to feel alone. However, your family in heaven stands beside you now.

Light shining from a dead star?That, by the way, is a phrase of Julian's. I remember it from a lecture of his on the Iliad, when Patroklos appears to Achilles in a dream. There is a very moving passage where Achilles overjoyed at the sight of the apparition – tries to throw his arms around the ghost of his old friend, and it vanishes. The dead appear to us in dreams, said Julian, because that's the only way they can make us see them; what we see is only a projection, beamed from a great distance, light shining at us from a dead star…Which reminds me, by the way, of a dream I had a couple of weeks ago.I found myself in a strange deserted city – an old city, like London – underpopulated by war or disease. It was night; the streets were dark, bombed-out, abandoned. For a long time, I wandered aimlessly – past ruined parks, blasted statuary, vacant lots overgrown with weeds and collapsed apartment houses with rusted girders poking out of their sides like ribs. But here and there, interspersed among the desolate shells of the heavy old public buildings, I began to see new buildings, too, which were connected by futuristic walkways lit from beneath. Long, cool perspectives of modern architecture, rising phosphorescent and eerie from the rubble.I went inside one of these new buildings. It was like a laboratory, maybe, or a museum. My footsteps echoed on the tile floors.There was a cluster of men, all smoking pipes, gathered around an exhibit in a glass case that gleamed in the dim light and lit their faces ghoulishly from below.I drew nearer. In the case was a machine revolving slowly on a turntable, a machine with metal parts that slid in and out and collapsed in upon themselves to form new images. An Inca temple… click click click… the Pyramids… the Parthenon.History passing beneath my very eyes, changing every moment.'I thought I'd find you here,' said a voice at my elbow.It was Henry. His gaze was steady and impassive in the dim light. Above his ear, beneath the wire stem of his spectacles, I could just make out the powder burn and the dark hole in his right temple.I was glad to see him, though not exactly surprised. 'You know,' I said to him, 'everybody is saying that you're dead.'He stared down at the machine. The Colosseum… click click click… the Pantheon. 'I'm not dead,' he said. 'I'm only having a bit of trouble with my passport.''What?'He cleared his throat. 'My movements are restricted,' he said.'I no longer have the ability to travel as freely as I would like.'Hagia Sophia. St. Mark's, in Venice. 'What is this place?' I asked him.'That information is classified, I'm afraid.'1 looked around curiously. It seemed that I was the only visitor.'Is it open to the public?' I said.'Not generally, no.'I looked at him. There was so much I wanted to ask him, so much I wanted to say; but somehow I knew there wasn't time and even if there was, that it was all, somehow, beside the point.'Are you happy here?' I said at last.He considered this for a moment. 'Not particularly,' he said.'But you're not very happy where you are, either.'St. Basil's, in Moscow. Chartres. Salisbury and Amiens. He glanced at his watch.'I hope you'll excuse me,' he said, 'but I'm late for an appointment.'He turned from me and walked away. I watched his back receding down the long, gleaming hall.” ― Donna Tartt, The Secret History"},{"quote":"“It was rather beautiful: the way he put her insecurities to sleep.

I thought a lot about what I should write to you. I thought of giving you blessings and wishes for things of great value to happen to you in future; I thought of appreciating you for being the way you are; I thought to give sweet and lovely compliments for everything about you; I thought to write something in praise of your poems and prose; and I thought of extending my gratitude for being one of the very few sincerest friends I have ever had. But that is what all friends do and they only qualify to remain as a part of the bunch of our loosely connected memories and that's not what I can choose to be, I cannot choose to be lost somewhere in your memories. So I thought of something through which I hope you will remember me for a very long time. I decided to share some part of my story, of what led me here, the part we both have had in common. A past, which changed us and our perception of the world. A past, which shaped our future into an unknown yet exciting opportunity to revisit the lost thoughts and to break free from the libido of our lost dreams. A past, which questioned our whole past. My dear, when the moment of my past struck me, in its highest demonised form, I felt dead, like a dead-man walking in flesh without a soul, who had no reason to live any more. I no longer saw any meaning of life but then I saw no reason to die as well. I travelled to far away lands, running away from friends, family and everyone else and I confined myself to my thoughts, to my feelings and to myself. Hours, days, weeks and months passed and I waited for a moment of magic to happen, a turn of destiny, but nothing happened, nothing ever happens. I waited and I counted each moment of it, thinking about every moment of my life, the good and the bad ones. I then saw how powerful yet weak, bright yet dark, beautiful yet ugly, joyous yet grievous; is a one single moment. One moment makes the difference. Just a one moment. Such appears to be the extreme and undisputed power of a single moment. We live in a world of appearance, Abigail, where the reality lies beyond the appearances, and this is also only what appears to be such powerful when in actuality it is not. I realised that the power of the moment is not in the moment itself. The power, actually, is in us. Every single one of us has the power to make and shape our own moments. It is us who by feeling joyful, celebrate for a moment of success; and it is also us who by feeling saddened, cry and mourn over our losses. I, with all my heart and mind, now embrace this power which lies within us. I wish life offers you more time to make use of this power. Remember, we are our own griefs, my dear, we are our own happinesses and we are our own remedies.Take care!Love,Francis.Title: Letter to AbigailScene: \"Death-bed\"Chapter: The Road To Awe” ― Huseyn Raza"},{"quote":"“Who am I?

It's been a while since I could remember any of my dreams, and still, this one has left me with such strong impression. Even now, when I am fully awake, your face flashes before my eyes. It's a face I can totally relate to, as if it wasn't any more yours than it is mine. Terrifying thing, you know? I can't say I've felt that sort of intimacy with anyone. For a moment you knew all my secrets, without me even having to tell them. For a moment I even knew them myself…While I was looking into your eyes, I suddenly started to realize things about myself that were unspoken for years, like fragments of my inner life that were deeply repressed. It’s hard to distinguish if they were buried inside because dealing with them was such a dirty work, or if leaving them unnamed meant that it was not possible to define them precisely enough, so they would keep their true meaning. Perhaps, all this life that I've known so far was in fact no more but a dream about living. The only thing that has kept me in touch with reality was you…I know it comes as a surprise, and you may be wondering why it took me so long to come clean. You also may be wondering how come you've never noticed before. I've tricked you on purpose, yes, and you must realize it really has nothing to do with you. It’s always been me. This is why, seeing you in my dream like that, came out as a shock. You also must forgive me. You must forgive me because I know how it looks like, that everything we ever shared was a lie, and it wasn't…I am more of an illusionist that a deceiver, but it all comes from being in fact, a very private person. Even if it was true that you knew me better than anyone, I’d never admit it. I’d rather dig my own heart out, with a rotten spoon, than admitting it. I may let people in my own little world occasionally, but I would never let them be aware of it. I don’t throw my intimacy in front of others, especially when I care. The more I care, the less I give away, and this is something for you to understand, and grant me your forgiveness. I didn't play my tricks on you in order to deceive you, but rather to save myself, and maybe even deceive myself as well. I’ve had hidden my feelings for you so deeply that I've learned to live with them, as if any other casualty. I have done wrong to myself as much as I did to you, and I don’t know if I can forgive myself. So now I wonder, could you forgive me without feeling sorry for me? I certainly don’t deserve your pity.

Human beings are its prisoners. The Predator is our lord and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don't do so... I have been beating around the bush all this time, insinuating to you that something is holding us prisoner. Indeed we are held prisoner! \"This was an energetic fact for the sorcerers of ancient Mexico ... They took us over because we are food for them, and they squeeze us mercilessly because we are their sustenance. just as we rear chickens in chicken coops, the predators rear us in human coops, humaneros. Therefore, their food is always available to them.\" \"No, no, no, no,\" [Carlos replies] \"This is absurd don Juan. What you're saying is something monstrous. It simply can't be true, for sorcerers or for average men, or for anyone.\" \"Why not?\" don Juan asked calmly. \"Why not? Because it infuriates you? ... You haven't heard all the claims yet. I want to appeal to your analytical mind. Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradictions between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs, or the stupidity of his contradictory behaviour. Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of belief, our ideas of good and evil, our social mores. They are the ones who set up our hopes and expectations and dreams of success or failure. They have given us covetousness, greed, and cowardice. It is the predators who make us complacent, routinary, and egomaniacal.\" \"'But how can they do this, don Juan? [Carlos] asked, somehow angered further by what [don Juan] was saying. \"'Do they whisper all that in our ears while we are asleep?\" \"'No, they don't do it that way. That's idiotic!\" don Juan said, smiling. \"They are infinitely more efficient and organized than that. In order to keep us obedient and meek and weak, the predators engaged themselves in a stupendous manoeuvre stupendous, of course, from the point of view of a fighting strategist. A horrendous manoeuvre from the point of view of those who suffer it. They gave us their mind! Do you hear me? The predators give us their mind, which becomes our mind. The predators' mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute now.\" \"I know that even though you have never suffered hunger... you have food anxiety, which is none other than the anxiety of the predator who fears that any moment now its manoeuvre is going to be uncovered and food is going to be denied. Through the mind, which, after all, is their mind, the predators inject into the lives of human beings whatever is convenient for them. And they ensure, in this manner, a degree of security to act as a buffer against their fear.\" \"The sorcerers of ancient Mexico were quite ill at ease with the idea of when [the predator] made its appearance on Earth. They reasoned that man must have been a complete being at one point, with stupendous insights, feats of awareness that are mythological legends nowadays. And then, everything seems to disappear, and we have now a sedated man. What I'm saying is that what we have against us is not a simple predator. It is very smart, and organized. It follows a methodical system to render us useless. Man, the magical being that he is destined to be, is no longer magical.

It was a small dream about time. I was dead, I guess, in deep black space high up among many white stars. My own consciousness had been disclosed to me, and I was happy. Then I saw far below me a long, curved band of color. As I came closer, I saw that it stretched endlessly in either direction, and I understood that I was seeing all the time of the planet where I had lived. It looked like a woman’s tweed scarf; the longer I studied any one spot, the more dots of color I saw. There was no end to the deepness and variety of the dots. At length, I started to look for my time, but, although more and more specks of color and deeper and more intricate textures appeared in the fabric, I couldn’t find my time, or any time at all that I recognized as being near my time. I couldn’t make out so much as a pyramid. Yet as I looked at the band of time, all the individual people, I understood with special clarity, were living at the very moment with great emotion, in intricate detail, in their individual times and places, and they were dying and being replaced by ever more people, one by one, like stitches in which whole worlds of feeling and energy were wrapped, in a never-ending cloth. I remembered suddenly the color and texture of our life as we knew it- these things had been utterly forgotten- and I thought as I searched for it on the limitless band, “that was a good time then, a good time to be living.”And I began to remember our time. I recalled green fields with carrots growing, one by one, in slender rows. Men and women in bright vests and scarves came and pulled the carrots out of the soil and carried them in baskets to shaded kitchens, where they scrubbed them with yellow brushes under running water…I saw may apples in forest, erupting through leaf-strewn paths. Cells on the root hairs of sycamores split and divided and apples grew striped and spotted in the fall. Mountains kept their cool caves, and squirrels raced home to their nests through sunlight and shade. I remembered the ocean, and I seemed to be in the ocean myself, swimming over orange crabs that looked like coral, or off the deep Atlantic banks where whitefish school. Or again I saw the tops of poplars, and the whole sky brushed with clouds in pallid streaks, under which wilds ducks flew, and called, one by one, and flew on. All these things I saw. Scenes grew in depth and sunlit detail before my eyes, and were replaced by ever more scenes, as I remembered the life of my time with increasing feeling. At last I saw the earth as a globe in space, and I recalled the ocean’s shape and the form of continents, saying to myself with surprise as I looked at the planet, “Yes, that’s how it was then, that part there we called ‘France’”. I was filled with the deep affection of nostalgia- and then I opened my eyes.” ― Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"},{"quote":"“By embracing your subconscious, you gain a different way of seeing and experiencing—an expanded perception that opens a doorway, not only to lucid dreams, but also to the mythic dimension.

I thought of one which might have been my earliest remembered nightmare. I was probably about four years old - I don't think I'd started school yet - when I woke up screaming. The image I retained of the dream, the thing which had frightened me so, was an ugly, clown-like doll made of soft red and cream-coloured rubber. When you squeezed it, bulbous eyes popped out on stalks and the mouth opened in a gaping scream. As I recall it now, it was disturbingly ugly, not really an appropriate toy for a very young child, but it had been mine when I was younger, at least until I'd bitten its nose off, at which point it had been taken away from me. At the time when I had the dream I hadn't seen it for a year or more - I don't think I consciously remembered it until its sudden looming appearance in a dream had frightened me awake. When I told my mother about the dream, she was puzzled.'But what's scary about that? You were never scared of that doll.' I shook my head, meaning that the doll I'd owned - and barely remembered - had never scared me. 'But it was very scary,' I said, meaning that the reappearance of it in my dream had been terrifying. My mother looked at me, baffled. 'But it's not scary,' she said gently. I'm sure she was trying to make me feel better, and thought this reasonable statement would help. She was absolutely amazed when it had the opposite result, and I burst into tears.Of course she had no idea why, and of course I couldn't explain. Now I think - and of course I could be wrong - that what upset me was that I'd just realized that my mother and I were separate people. We didn't share the same dreams or nightmares. I was alone in the universe, like everybody else. In some confused way, that was what the doll had been telling me. Once it had loved me enough to let me eat its nose; now it would make me wake up screaming.

It derives from the Greek, oneiro, meaning dream. The Five Pillars of Dreamscapes is a guide based on initial Oneirologist research from the 1900’s. They will include field experiments introducing the five basic foundations, known as Pillars. These basic Pillars will be needed to begin and maintain lucid dreaming.Pillar One – ANCHOR. Maintain control upon arrival in a shared dream state. Invade and place a marker or anchor to stabilize your placement.Pillar Two – SAILS. Leave a link in both sleeping and dream worlds. Self. Aware. In. Lost. State. Travel freely in both states.Pillar Three – SWIM. Immersion into another dream for control. Invade and manipulate the environment for control in the shared dream.Pillar Four – TEMPO – Time manipulation in the shared dream state. Control perception of time as you create in a shared dream.Pillar Five – MANIFESTATION – Create an avatar in a shared dream to conceal your identity. Hide behind a mask upon dream invasions. Half of the human population has experienced lucid dreaming, when the dreamer can control what happens while asleep. Being aware of your consciousness while in a lucid dream is a form of metacognition. The Five Pillars outlined in this book will improve your awareness of your awareness while dreaming. These basic steps need to be learned and mastered to better interpret dream metacognition. The Fifth Pillar, MANIFESTATION, might be the most important to create over time.

Dans ce dernier il trouva un livre sur sa table, sans savoir qui l’y avait mis. Il l’ouvrit, et voyant que c’était un Dictionnaire, il en fut ravi dans l’espérance qu’il pourrait lui être fort utile. Dans le même instant, il se rencontra un autre livre sous sa main, qui ne lui était pas moins nouveau, ne sachant d’où il lui était venu. Il trouva que c’était un recueil des poésies de différents auteurs, intitulé Corpus Poetarum, etc. Il eut la curiosité d’y vouloir lire quelque chose : et à l’ouverture du livre il tomba sur le vers «Quod vitae sectabor iter ? » [«Quel chemin suivrai-je dans la vie» ?] Au même moment il aperçut un homme qu’il ne connaissait pas, mais qui lui présenta une pièce de vers, commençant par «Est et Non» (1), et qui la lui vantoit comme une pièce excellente. M. Descartes lui dit qu’il savait ce que c’était, et que cette pièce était parmi les «Idylles» d’Ausone qui se trouvait dans le gros Recueil des Poètes qui était sur sa table(2). Il voulut la montrer lui-même à cet homme et il se mit à feuilleter le livre dont il se vantait de connaître parfaitement l’ordre et l’économie. Pendant qu’il cherchait l’endroit, l’homme lui demanda où il avait pris ce livre, et M. Descartes lui répondit qu’il ne pouvait lui dire comment il l’avait eu, mais qu’un moment auparavant il en avait manié encore un autre qui venait de disparaître, sans savoir qui le lui avait apporté, ni qui le lui avait repris. Il n’avait pas achevé, qu’il revit paraître le livre à l’autre bout de la table. Mais il trouva que ce Dictionnaire n’était plus entier comme il l’avait vu la première fois(3). Cependant il en vint aux poésies d’Ausone dans le recueil des poètes qu’il feuilletait et ne pouvant trouver la pièce qui commence par «Est et non», il dit à cet homme qu’il en connaissait une du même poète encore plus belle que celle-là, et qu’elle commençait par «Quod vitae sectabor iter ? » La personne le pria de la lui montrer, et M. Descartes se mettait en devoir de la chercher, lorsqu’il tomba sur divers petits portraits gravés en taille douce : ce qui lui fit dire que ce livre était fort beau, mais qu’il n’était pas de la même impression que celui qu’il connaissait. Il en était là, lorsque les livres et l’homme disparurent, et s’effacèrent de son imagination, sans néanmoins le réveiller.[...] [...] [...] Ce dernier songe qui n’avait eu rien que de fort doux et de fort agréable, marquait l’avenir selon lui et il n’était que pour ce qui devait lui arriver dans le reste de sa vie. Mais il prit les deux précédents pour des avertissements menaçants touchant sa vie passée, qui pouvait n’avoir pas été aussi innocente devant Dieu que devant les hommes. Et il crut que c’était la raison de la terreur et de l’effroi dont ces deux songes étaient accompagnés. Le melon dont on voulait lui faire présent dans le premier songe, signifiait, disait-il, les charmes de la solitude, mais présentés par des sollicitations purement humaines. Le vent qui le poussoit vers l’église du collège, lorsqu’il avait mal au côté droit, n’était autre chose que le mauvais génie qui tâchait de le jeter par force dans un lieu où son dessein était d’aller volontairement. C’est pourquoi Dieu ne permit pas qu’il avançât plus loin, et qu’il se laissât emporter même en un lieu saint par un esprit qu’il n’avoit pas envoyé quoiqu’il fût très persuadé que ç’eût été l’esprit de Dieu qui lui avait fait faire les prémières démarches vers cette église. L’épouvante dont il fut frappé dans le second songe, marquait, à son sens, sa syndérêse, c’est-à-dire, les remords de sa conscience touchant les péchés qu’il pouvait avoir commis pendant le cours de sa vie jusqu’alors. La foudre dont il entendit l’éclat, était le signal de l’esprit de vérité qui descendait sur lui pour le posséder.” ― Adrien Baillet, La Vie de M. Descartes"},{"quote":"“In this life, we work ten times harder than anyone—not for fame, not for approval, but to earn the right to bring our dreams to life. Every note, every lyric, every breath we put into our art is carved from sacrifice and fire. When a song is finally complete, I cry—not from sadness, but from the overwhelming truth that a dream has just been conquered. And I do it again the next day, and the next. I’ve written over 1000 songs, created 672 soundtracks, and authored 3 books—not for applause, but because this is how I survive, how I rise. Each creation is a monument to persistence, a heartbeat of resilience. People see the result, but they don’t see the nights, the tears, the silence we endure. But we keep going.

Those who died were nearly all rescue workers who were exposed acutely. The report predicted that that number could eventually climb to 4,000, as older people eventually died of cancer that could have been related to the exposure.

These trees are absolutely real - but the way you see these trees is unreal. These trees are not unreal in themselves - they exist in god, they exist in absolute reality - but the way you see them you never see them; you are seeing something else, a mirage.You create your own dream around you and unless you become awake you will continue to dream. The world is unreal because the world that you know is the world of your dreams. When dreams drop and you simply encounter the world that is there, then the real world.There are not two things, god and the world. God is the world if you have eyes, clear eyes, without any dreams, without any dust of the dreams, without any haze of sleep; if you have clear eyes, clarity, perceptiveness, there is only god.Then somewhere god is a green tree, and somewhere else god is a shining star, and somewhere else god is a cuckoo, and somewhere else god is a flower, and somewhere else a child and somewhere else a river - then only god is. The moment you start seeing, only god is.But right now whatsoever you see is not the truth, it is a projected lie. That is the meaning of a mirage. And once you see, even for a single split moment, if you can see, if you can allow yourself to see, you will find immense benediction present all over, everywhere - in the clouds, in the sun, on the earth.This is a beautiful world. But I am not talking about your world, I am talking about my world. Your world is very ugly, your world is your world created by a self, your world is a projected world. You are using the real world as a screen and projecting your own ideas on it.When I say the world is real, the world is tremendously beautiful, the world is luminous with infinity, the world is light and delight, it is a celebration, I mean my world - or your world if you drop your dreams.When you drop your dreams you see the same world as any Buddha has ever seen. When you dream you dream privately. Have you watched it? - that dreams are private. You cannot share them even with your beloved. You cannot invite your wife to your dream - or your husband, or your friend. You cannot say, 'Now, please come tonight in my dream. I would like to see the dream together.' It is not possible. Dream is a private thing, hence it is illusory, it has no objective reality.God is a universal thing. Once you come out of your private dreams, it is there. It has been always there. Once your eyes are clear, a sudden illumination - suddenly you are overflooded with beauty, grandeur and grace.

Yet, if I dare to be thankful for the fact that what I do have will always outweigh what I don’t, that everything that didn’t work places me one step closer to that which will, and that the death of one dream creates a space for the birth of a greater one, negativity will perish, light will dawn, and I will never fall to any of these things again.” ― Craig D.

There is will in thought, there is none in dreams. Reverie, which is utterly spontaneous, takes and keeps, even in the gigantic and the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul, than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in deliberate, rational co-ordinated ideas, is the real character of a man to be found. Our chimæras are the things which the most resemble us.

Her arms extended gracefully above her, eyes closed, she seemed to dance on the edge of dreams. The flowers painted the canvas in shades of blue, purple, and pink, their petals swaying in a tender breeze. Dew-kissed blades of grass formed a sea of diamonds, reflecting the soft glow of an unseen moon.As the girl stirred in her slumber, a distant echo of horse steps reached her ears, a melody that danced through the flowered meadow. Slowly, she rose from her flowery bed, the veil slipping away like morning mist to unveil her enchanting presence. Her gown, a masterpiece of celestial elegance, cascaded around her. A floor-length creation in light blue, it cradled her form with a sweetheart neckline, the bodice adorned in gold, floral designs. Layers of tulle formed the flowing skirt, adorned with accents of blueish flowers, and a train that trailed behind her like a comet's tail.Around her neck hung a pendant, a crescent moon cradling a star, both crafted from silver and adorned with blue gemstones, a twin to the one she wore in the enchanted garden. Her golden locks, a cascade of loose curls, framed her face with ethereal grace, flowing like strands of sunlight.Awakening from the meadow's embrace, her deep blue eyes sought the source of the approaching steps. With a sense of dreamlike purpose, she floated towards the sound, the forest mist enveloping her like a lover's caress. In the heart of the foggy woodland, a clearing revealed itself, trees standing sentinel in the distance.From the shroud of mist emerged a figure on horseback, a man in the regalia of a medieval warrior. The horse, a noble steed of white, carried him forward with determined grace. His attire, a tapestry of dark fabric and gilded accents, spoke of a history steeped in honor and battle. High collars and embroidered shoulder pads, buttons, and chains of gold, all adorned his form. His cape billowed behind him, a canvas of golden threads dancing in the breeze.Their eyes met innocence and determination woven together in the tapestry of fate. As he approached, still astride his noble mount, he extended a hand, a silent invitation. With an innocence that matched the morning dew, she lifted her hand to meet his, and at that moment, the world seemed to swirl and dance around them.Yet, just as the dance was about to begin, Princess Mehjabeen's eyes fluttered open, the enchanting dream slipping away like mist beneath the twilight.” ― Haala Humayun, The Legend of Tilsim Hoshruba"},{"quote":"“Your desire You desire to shine To be understoodTo be respectedTo be lovedConsumes youThe beauty-drinking eyes That feast upon dreamsCalls your nameLove I love you” ― Kenan Hudaverdi"},{"quote":"“All of us are dreamers; even a mad man has a dream as well. but 5% of dreamers achieving greatness and success in life.” ― Onipede Ayomide"},{"quote":"“Books are not just made of paper and ink; they're woven with dreams and imagination.” ― Umesha Chathurangi Handapangoda"},{"quote":"“Do not pre-announce your dreams and visions in public; your future infants will be born prematurely.” ― Luckson T Mabade"},{"quote":"“The most fascinating myths are the ones that are not.” ― Craig D.

Just as a river, when it is split into countless rivulets, loses its force and becomes but a whimper, a mind divided by trivial pursuits dissipates its strength.

What I know is when You put a dream in Someone's Heart You don't let that disappear just like that, You have your reason to even let that dream shape in, and mine has always been the most simplest and the most humblest of all. It doesn't matter how archaic or regressive it seems I would always imagine the most beautiful of all pathways is the route where two hearts connect and grow old together, when two souls find a Home together and that would always be my dearest prayer, and so I know that You know how that Prayer churns my Soul. I pray before You to give me Hope, to give me the heart to wait in Patience as You work on him and send him to my path in Your way for in You I trust blindly. I pray that You bless all lone hearts and give them courage and wisdom to learn the true meaning of Togetherness, to understand the true meaning of Companionship and above all the sanctity of Home, where children are born of Love, where hearts are united in Trust and Respect, so yes I pray with all my Heart that wherever he is, whoever he is, You bless him with my aura and make him grow in ways that only You can, that You paint his dreams and bless them in Your colour of Hope and Success, that You hold his hand and let him win in life in ways that You alone can. I know I would know my deepest Happiness in his smile, for I know whoever he is, wherever he is, his soul and mine are one, and soon in Your Timing, You will find Him in my Life, for Our Home would be Your Smile of Love.

You put your arm around her. She leans against you. And a long spell of time passes. \"Did you know that I did this exact same thing a long time ago? Right in this same spot?\" \"I know,\" you tell her. \"How do you know that?' Miss Saeki asks, and looks you in the eyes. \"I was there then.\" \"Blowing up bridges?\" \"Yes, I was there, blowing up bridges.\" \"Metaphorically.\" \"Of course.\" You hold her in your arms, draw her close, kiss her. You can feel the strength deserting her body. \"We're all dreaming, aren't we?\" she says. All of us are dreaming. \"Why did you have to die?\" \"I couldn't help it,\" you reply. Together you walk along the beach back to the library. You turn off the light in your room, draw the curtains, and without another word climb into bed and make love. Pretty much the same sort of lovemaking as the night before. But with two differences. After sex, she starts to cry. That's one. She buries her face in the pillow and silently weeps. You don't know what to do. You gently lay a hand on her bare shoulder. You know you should say something, but don't have any idea what. Words have all died in the hollow of time, piling up soundlessly at the dark bottom of a volcanic lake. And this time as she leaves you can hear the engine of her car. That's number two. She starts the engine, turns it off for a time, like she's thinking about something, then turns the key again and drives out of the parking lot. That blank, silent interval between leaves you sad, so terribly sad. Like fog from the sea, that blankness wends its way into your heart and remains there for a long, long time. Finally it's a part of you. She leaves behind a damp pillow, wet with her tears. You touch the warmth with your hand and watch the sky outside gradually lighten. Far away a crow caws. The Earth slowly keeps on turning. But beyond any of those details of the real, there are dreams. And everyone's living in them.” ― Haruki Murakami"},{"quote":"“God is indefinable, so no word is really adequate enough to describe him, but we have to use words.This is one of the most beautiful words which comes very close in describing god. God is as infinite as the sky, as unbounded as the whole universe. No boundaries, no limits – and that’s your nature too: god is your nature.God is not something outside, not something that belongs to the existence. It is the center of all, it is as much yours as it is anybody else’s. We are different on the circumference but we are one at the center. No difference at all at the center. The farther we go from the center we start becoming different; we start becoming persons, we start gathering personality, we start becoming faces, masks. The closer we come to the center the masks start disappearing, the personality starts evaporating, we start becoming one.That’s what I mean when I say: No man is an island. We are part of a vast continent, of an infinity, of an eternity, beginningless, endless. To know it brings great rejoicing, obviously, because to know it means there is no death, to know it means you have been here forever and you will be here forever. To know it means your inner purity is absolutely virgin, it has not been polluted. Thousands of lives have happened but it has not polluted you. Those lives have been just dreams. You have dreamed many dreams in the night but in the morning you are not polluted by your dreams. You may have been a murderer in the dream or you may have been a mahatma in the dream – it doesn’t matter. Whether you were a mahatma or a murderer, in the morning you find both were dreams, both were false and your reality has remained unaffected. Many stories we have lived, many dramas we have played. Many roles we have passed through, but this is the miracle that we are absolutely unaffected, we are virgin.Our inner purity is incorruptible.Meditation will give you a taste of that incorruptible purity, of that incorruptible innocence and from there, one can jump into the ultimate, into the infinite.” ― Osho"},{"quote":"“If everyone is dreaming the same thing, then no one is truly dreaming.” ― Joshua Krook , Black Friday 2050"},{"quote":"“The idea of an idea can be as powerful as the idea itself.” ― Craig D.

In this way the story tells us that the subtlety of the inventions of the unconscious and the secret design woven into a human life are infinitely more intelligent than human consciousness and more subtle and superior than man could invent. One is again and again overwhelmed by the genius of that unknown mysterious something in our psyche which is the inventor of our dreams, It picks elements from day impressions, from something the dreamer has read the evening before in the paper, or from a childhood memory, and makes a nice kind of potpourri out of it, and only when you have interpreted its meaning do you see the subtlety and the genius of each dream composition. Every night we have that carpet weaver at work within us, who makes those fantastically subtle patterns, so subtle that, unfortunately often after an hour's attempt to interpret them, we are unable to find out the meaning.We are just too clumsy and stupid to follow up the genius of that unknown spirit of the unconscious which invents dreams.

She- you were dreaming. I was in your dream, watching as you had a nightmare about some woman slitting your throat, while you were chased by the Bogge... I couldn't reach you, speak to you.

For years, he dreamed about having a bright future in the United States. At seven, he promised his mother that one day he would be a doctor in America and take her and his siblings away from their dangerous and impoverished existence. By the age of thirty-three, ‘Deji had been in the United States for five years and was living his dream. He had earned a master’s degree, married and had a child, been recruited into the Navy, and become a US citizen. He makes good on the promise to his mother and brings her, his sister, and his sister’s baby to the United States.UNDERGROUND: A Memoir of Hope, Faith, and the American Dream is a well-structured, compelling memoir written by a determined man with big dreams, ambitious goals, and the strength to never lose sight of where he is headed. Commitment, intelligence, and drive contribute to his fulfilling what he deems to be his purpose in life. His accomplishments in the armed services are nothing short of admirable. Ayoade draws readers into the 1980s culture of the poorer regions of Nigeria with vivid descriptions of the sights, sounds, and smells of areas in which they lived. His credible recreation of scenes reveals insight into the civilization that had considerable influence on him. Family dynamics also play a significant role in Ayoade’s life. His recollection of his father’s contradictory behaviors both confuse and enlighten him. His fond memories of his grandmother—the family member he trusted the most—are heartfelt and touching.While coming to the United States offers many positive experiences for Ayoade, it doesn’t come without problems, and one that the author talks about with deep emotion and candidness is racism. Thoughtful in the way he acknowledges possible differences of perspectives, he describes how it feels to be looked at differently. One scene in particular demonstrates just how prejudiced and insensitive people can be when it comes to racial biases. Ayoade writes from the heart with emotion and honesty that demonstrate his passion for what he does in life. His ability to weave together a cohesive story from so many disparate fragments is remarkable. His religious faith and commitment to never-ending improvement for himself are inspiring and a basis for being a role model for others.UNDERGROUND: A Memoir of Hope, Faith, and the American Dream–author ‘Deji Ayoade’s reflections on overcoming enormous obstacles and emigrating from Nigeria to the United States–is candid, heartwarming, and inspirational.” ― IndieReader"},{"quote":"“Never give up.

Thus you can expect many insults, wars, and hatred whenever you, a nation or the whole world is moving upwards.

The rationalists will never understand this because they are obsessed with explaining a world they know too little about. As a matter of fact, you won't need to concern your mind with agreements between opposing forces but simply with evolving. When you find yourself discussing the color of the sky, or the reason for your emotions or your dreams with others, you are wasting your time. What is, is as it is, and needs only to be seen.

If therefore time takes time there must be a time outside of time. He called this \"time 2\". [...]Most of our life we live in \"time 1\", which is synonymous with the passing ordinary moments of everyday life. But during sleep a part of our personality (observer 2) can slip into this other dimension of time and experience events in the future which are communicated to our ordinary self (observer 1).Investigations led Dunne to conclude that under certain circumstances past, present and future events were accessible to consciousness and that during dreams we can enter this fourth dimension of space-time.” ― Craig Hamilton-Parker, Your Psychic Powers: A Beginner's Guide"},{"quote":"“On earth, Marguerite said, when you fell asleep, you sometimes dreamed your heaven and those dreams helped to form it.” ― Mitch Albom, The Five People You Meet in Heaven"},{"quote":"“And then he wakes up.

Life and dreams are leaves of one and the same book. The systematic reading is real life, but when the actual reading hour (the day) has come to an end, and we have the period of recreation, we often continue idly to thumb over the leaves, and turn to a page here and there without method or connexion. We sometimes turn up a page we have already read, at others one still unknown to us, but always from the same book. Such an isolated page is, of course, not connected with a consistent reading and study of the book, yet it is not so very inferior thereto, if we note that the whole of the consistent perusal begins and ends also on the spur of the moment, and can therefore be regarded merely as a larger single page.Thus, although individual dreams are marked off from real life by the fact that they do not fit into the continuity of experience that runs constantly through life, and waking up indicates this difference, yet that very continuity of experience belongs to real life as its form, and the dream can likewise point to a continuity in itself. Now if we assume a standpoint of judgement external to both, we find no distinct difference in their nature, and are forced to concede to the poets that life is a long dream.” ― Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Volume I"},{"quote":"“How memories desert us.

My environment had not been shaken, so my diary, in reality, really did contain an entry labeled A Philosophical Aspect. Furthermore, in dreaming, my reasoning and cognitive abilities tend to be very limited, because I’m hardly awake, but I was actually thinking about verifying that my perception was a perception of reality. I also realized that I maintained this thought process for extended periods of time, which meant that I had not been dreaming. The thought process, if I were dreaming, should have been short, because utilizing reflective thinking and reasoning, in my case, was in the closest proximity to being awake. When I reflectively think and reason in a dream, I start waking up, so any deep thinking in a dream would immediately end due to the fact that it would be interrupted while I am waking up. If I weren’t dreaming, I would continue my deep thinking instead of stopping to wake up. My cognitive abilities were obviously too strong and long-lasting to imply that I was dreaming.” ― Lucy Carter, The Reformation"},{"quote":"“How do you become God? You train yourself. Anyone can become God. Because the unconscious is God. Every time you dream, you are God. Nothing is more creative than a dream, and everyone dreams. In your dreams, you create whole worlds, and entire casts of characters, out of nothing. You do it … effortlessly. It’s your consciousness that struggles. Do you understand the game? You are God … but God has no idea who God is, or what God is. So, the part of you that is God does not know it is God. The part of you that knows that part of you is God isn’t God. The part that knows, the part that isn’t God, is consciousness. The part that doesn’t know, the part that is God, is the unconscious. The cosmic comedy, or is it tragedy, is that God doesn’t know he is God. He’s not suffering from amnesia. He never knew. That’s why consciousness exists. It’s the means for God to become aware he is God. God is creativity, but he doesn’t know what to create. That’s the cosmic irony. He can create anything, yet has to be told what to create.” ― Rob Armstrong, Homo Roboticus: The Inner Human Robot Revealed By Sleepwalking and Hypnosis"},{"quote":"“Our psyche is astonishingly fissile.

She was lost to it. She was coming apart.She knew the danger. The idea of resistance fashioned itself into a sword in her mind, a bright-edged sword, a way out. But the sword itself became smoke; and the thing she would slash free of became smoke. The effort to resist required too much, too mighty a cut, too great a mental stroke. Her mind was coming apart.Honora belonged to the fire. She was enslaved by the ritual dance of the aromatic flame. Fire, first and most martial of all elements, the hierarchical prince. She saw in the fire the tapered banners of his glorious armies, the swallowtail, pennants a-flutter, flags of crimson, ochre, sapphire, armies spilling into valleys and camped along the plains.
