This, as you might imagine, proved problematic. Their romance disrupted the flow of time. It tangled the strings of fortune into knots. The stars watched from the heavens nervously, worrying what might occur. What might happen to the days and nights were time to suffer a broken heart? What catastrophes might result if the same fate awaited Fate itself? The stars conspired and separated the two. For a while they breathed easier in the heavens. Time continued to flow as it always had, or perhaps imperceptibly slower. Fate weaved together the paths that were meant to intertwine, though perhaps a string was missed here and there. But eventually, Fate and Time found each other again. In the heavens, the stars sighed, twinkling and fretting. They asked the Moon her advice. The Moon in turn called upon the parliament of owls to decide how best to proceed. The parliament of owls convened to discuss the matter amongst themselves night after night. They argued and debated while the world slept around them, and the world continued to turn, unaware that such important matters were under discussion while it slumbered. The parliament of owls came to the logical conclusion that if the problem was in the combination, one of the elements should be removed. They chose to keep the one they felt more important. The parliament of owls told their decision to the stars and the stars agreed. The Moon did not, but on this night she was dark and could not offer her opinion. So it was decided, and Fate was pulled apart. Ripped into pieces by beaks and claws. Fate’s screams echoed through the deepest corners and the highest heavens but no one dared to intervene save for a small brave mouse who snuck into the fray, creeping unnoticed through the blood and bone and feathers, and took Fate’s heart and kept it safe. When the furor died down there was nothing else left of Fate. The owl who consumed Fate’s eyes gained great site, greater site then any that had been granted to a mortal creature before. The Parliament crowned him the Owl King. In the heavens the stars sparkled with relief but the moon was full of sorrow. And so time goes as it should and events that were once fated to happen are left instead to chance, and Chance never falls in love with anything for long. But the world is strange and endings are not truly endings no matter how the stars might wish it so. Occasionally Fate can pull itself together again.

Ideally, it would be a straight path forward––we'd always know where we were going, we'd always be able to move on and leave everything else behind. There would be nothing but the present and the future. Instead, we always find ourselves where we started. When we try to move ahead, we end up taking a step back. We carry everything with us, the weight exhausting us until we want to collapse and give up. We forget things we try to remember. We remember things we'd rather forget. The most frightening thing about memory is that it leaves no choice. It has mastered an incomprehensible art of forgetting. It erases, it smudges, it fills in blank spaces with details that don't exist. But however we remember it––or choose to remember it––the past is the foundation that holds our lives in place. Without its support, we'd have nothing for guidance. We spend so much time focused on what lies ahead, when what has fallen behind is just as important. What defines us isn't where we're going, but where we've been. Although there are places and people we will never see again, and although we move on and let them go, they remain a part of who we are. There are things that will never change, things we will carry along with us always.

The context is the constellation of elements, harmoniously arranged that encompass the experience of the amorous subject...Love at first sight is always spoken in the past tense. The scene is perfectly adapted to this temporal phenomenon: distinct, abrupt, framed, it is already a memory (the nature of a photograph is not to represent but to memorialize)... this scene has all the magnificence of an accident: I cannot get over having had this good fortune: to meet what matches my desire.The gesture of the amorous embrace seems to fulfill, for a time, the subject's dream of total union with the loved being: The longing for consummation with the other... In this moment, everything is suspended: time, law, prohibition: nothing is exhausted, nothing is wanted: all desires are abolished, for they seem definitively fulfilled...

If he be an imaginative boy a door is torn open and for the first time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as though they marched in procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his time have come out of nothingness into the world, lived their lives and again disappeared into nothingness. The sadness of sophistication has come to the boy. With a little gasp he sees himself as merely a leaf blown by the wind through the streets of his village. He knows that in spite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die in uncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a thing destined like corn to wilt in the sun.” ― Sherwood Anderson, Winesburg, Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small Town Life"},{"quote":"“Only human after all, she whispered.” ― Gabriel F.W.

And if I can tell an old-time story now about a man who is walking about, waudjoset ndatlokugan, a forest lodge man, alesakamigwi udlagwedewugan, it is because I spent many years walking about myself, listening to voices that came not just from the people but from animals and trees and stones.” ― Joseph Bruchac"},{"quote":"“How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,Stol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!” ― John Milton"},{"quote":"“Want to have a short phone call with someone?

Well crafted, obviously, with intricately carved woodwork edges and a perfectly painted face, but just a clock.But that is before it is wound. Before it begins to tick, the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly. Then, then it becomes something else.The changes are slow. First, the color changes in the face, shifts from white to grey, and then there are clouds that float across it, disappearing when they reach the opposite side. Meanwhile, bits of the body of the clock expand and contract, like pieces of a puzzle. As though the clock is falling apart, slowly and gracefully.All of this takes hours.The face of the clock becomes a darker grey, and then black, with twinkling stars where numbers had been previously. The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn. There is a silver dragon that curls around part of the now visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress, awaiting an absent prince. Teapots that pour into teacups and minuscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick. Wrapped presents open. Small cats chase small dogs. An entire game of chess is played.At the center, where a cuckoo bird would live in a more traditional timepiece, is the juggler. Dress in harlequin style with a grey mask, he juggles shiny silver balls that correspond to each hour. As the clock chimes, another ball joins the rest until at midnight he juggles twelve balls in a complex pattern.After midnight, the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself. The face lightens and the cloud returns. The number of juggled balls decreases until the juggler himself vanishes.By noon it is a clock again, and no longer a dream.” ― Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus"},{"quote":"“I'm wishing he could see that music lives.

Proper utilization of time is so important. While we have this body, and especially this amazing human brain, I think every minute is something precious. Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow at this time we will be here. But we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time. I believe that the proper utilization of time is this: if you can, serve other people, other sentient beings. If not, at least refrain from harming them. I think that is the whole basis of my philosophy.So, let us reflect what is truly of value in life, what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. The purpose of our life needs to be positive. We weren't born with the purpose of causing trouble, harming others. For our life to be of value, I think we must develop basic good human qualities—warmth, kindness, compassion.

To heat a liquid with an electric lamp requires not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as to give heat instead of light. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth's surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal line which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into lifting power. Similarly, the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is the most brilliant or their culture the most extensive, but those who have had the power, ceasing suddenly to live only for themselves, to transform their personality into a sort of mirror, in such a way that their life, however mediocre it may be socially and even, in a sense, intellectually, is reflected by it, genius consisting in reflecting power and not int he intrinsic quality of the scene reflected.” ― Marcel Proust, Within a Budding Grove, Part 2"},{"quote":"“These creatures are not humanoid.

Consciousness grows independent of the ordinary senses. You see without assistance from the eyes, over distances beyond the visual horizon. There are moments when existence appears independent even of the mind. The importance of physical desire and immediate surroundings is submerged in the apprehension of universal values.For unmeasurable periods, I seem divorced from my body, as though I were an awareness spreading out through space, over the earth and into the heavens, unhampered by time or substance, free from the gravitation that binds to heavy human problems of the world. My body requires no attention. It's not hungry. It's neither warm or cold. It's resigned to being left undisturbed. Why have I troubled to bring it here? I might better have left it back at Long Island or St. Louis, while the weightless element that has lived within it flashes through the skies and views the planet. This essential consciousness needs no body for its travels. It needs no plane, no engine, no instruments, only the release from flesh which circumstances I've gone through make possible.Then what am I – the body substance which I can see with my eyes and feel with my hands? Or am I this realization, this greater understanding which dwells within it, yet expands through the universe outside; a part of all existence, powerless but without need for power; immersed in solitude, yet in contact with all creation? There are moments when the two appear inseparable, and others when they could be cut apart by the merest flash of light.While my hand is on the stick, my feet on the rudder, and my eyes on the compass, this consciousness, like a winged messenger, goes out to visit the waves below, testing the warmth of water, the speed of wind, the thickness of intervening clouds. It goes north to the glacial coasts of Greenland, over the horizon to the edge of dawn, ahead to Ireland, England, and the continent of Europe, away through space to the moon and stars, always returning, unwillingly, to the mortal duty of seeing that the limbs and muscles have attended their routine while it was gone.” ― Charles A.

It will only yield to a change in the very way we feel about time. The value of time must change for us. And then the way we think about it will change, naturally and wisely. That change in feeling and in thinking is combined in the words of a prophet of God in this dispensation. It was Brigham Young, and the year was 1877, and he was speaking at April general conference. He wasn't talking about time or schedules or frustrations with too many demands upon us. Rather, he was trying to teach the members of the Church how to unite themselves in what was called the united order. The Saints were grappling with the question of how property should be distributed if they were to live the celestial law. In his usual direct style, he taught the people that they were having trouble finding solutions because they misunderstood the problem. Particularly, he told them they didn't understand either property or the distribution of wealth. Here is what he said: With regard to our property, as I have told you many times, the property which we inherit from our Heavenly Father is our time, and the power to choose in the disposition of the same. This is the real capital that is bequeathed unto us by our Heavenly Father; all the rest is what he may be pleased to add unto us. To direct, to counsel and to advise in the disposition of our time, pertains to our calling as God's servants, according to the wisdom which he has given and will continue to give unto us as we seek it. [JD 18:354] Time is the property we inherit from God, along with the power to choose what we will do with it. President Young calls the gift of life, which is time and the power to dispose of it, so great an inheritance that we should feel it is our capital. The early Yankee families in America taught their children and grandchildren some rules about an inheritance. They were always to invest the capital they inherited and live only on part of the earnings. One rule was \"Never spend your capital.\" And those families had confidence the rule would be followed because of an attitude of responsibility toward those who would follow in later generations. It didn't always work, but the hope was that inherited wealth would be felt a trust so important that no descendent would put pleasure ahead of obligation to those who would follow. Now, I can see and hear Brigham Young, who was as flinty a New Englander as the Adams or the Cabots ever hoped to be, as if he were leaning over this pulpit tonight. He would say something like this, with a directness and power I wish I could approach: \"Your inheritance is time. It is capital far more precious than any lands or stocks or houses you will ever get. Spend it foolishly, and you will bankrupt yourself and cheapen the inheritance of those that follow you. Invest it wisely, and you will bless generations to come. “A Child of Promise”, BYU Speeches, 4 May 1986” ― Henry B. Eyring"},{"quote":"“Time, I think, is like walking backward away from something: say, from a kiss. First there is the kiss; then you step back, and the eyes fill up your vision, then the eyes are framed in the face as you step further away; the face then is part of a body, and then the body is framed in a doorway, then the doorway framed in the trees beside it. The path grows longer and the door smaller, the trees fill up your sight and the door is lost, then the path is lost in the woods and the woods lost in the hills.

A motion is termed uniform in which equal increments of space described correspond to equal increments of space described by some motion with which we form a comparison, as the rotation of the earth. A motion may, with respect to another motion, be uniform. But the question whether a motion is in itself uniform, is senseless. With just as little justice, also, may we speak of an “absolute time” --- of a time independent of change.

Modern man need not become a hermit to achieve this goal, for it is neither ecstasy nor world-estranged mysticism his era demands, but a balance between quantitative and qualitative reality. Modern man, with his reduced capacity for intuitive perception, is unlikely to benefit from the contemplative life of a hermit in the wilderness. But what he can do is to give undivided attention, at times, to a natural phenomenon, observing it in detail, and recalling all the scientific facts about it he may remember. Gradually, however, he must silence his thoughts and, for moments at least, forget all his personal cares and desires, until nothing remains in his soul but awe for the miracle before him. Such efforts are like journeys beyond the boundaries of narrow self-love and, although the process of intuitive awakening is laborious and slow, its rewards are noticeable from the very first. If pursued through the course of years, something will begin to stir in the human soul, a sense of kinship with the forces of life consciousness which rule the world of plants and animals, and with the powers which determine the laws of matter. While analytical intellect may well be called the most precious fruit of the Modern Age, it must not be allowed to rule supreme in matters of cognition. If science is to bring happiness and real progress to the world, it needs the warmth of man's heart just as much as the cold inquisitiveness of his brain.” ― Franz Winkler"},{"quote":"“You could lose the ones you loved in the blink of an eye—and he was willing to bet, when it happened, you weren’t thinking about all the reasons that could have kept you apart.

We don't know how much of everything we have ahead of us so we have to take the greatest precautions not to destroy the beauty of what we have. Everything exists in limited quantity-especially happiness. If a love is to come into being, it is all written down somewhere, and also its duration and content. If you could arrive at the complete intensity the first day, it would be ended the first day. And so if it's something you want so much that you'd like to have it prolonged in time, you must be extremely careful not to make the slightest excessive demand that might prevent it from developing to the greatest extent over the longest period...If the wings of the butterfly are to keep their sheen, you mustn't touch them.

These classical projections, and something in the physical attitudes of the men themselves as they turned from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin’s scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outwards like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure: stepping slowly, methodically, sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seeminly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.” ― Anthony Powell, A Question of Upbringing"},{"quote":"“TJ frowns; she can’t write about willing wind and water in the official report.

They never say you can’t do this or no one can do that or that thing is impossible just because they couldn’t do it, or because they hadn’t found it yet. True masters answer differently. Wisely. Like her grandmother answered that day. “Do you know why we evolve, Tirity?” “Because we’re supposed to?” TJ replied.“Yes. It’s in the grand design. We’re ‘supposed to’ evolve. Not just in body, but also in mind,” she said. “In time. You see, time is the key. If given infinite time, you can evolve your mind infinitely. But we live only for a hundred years or so.” “A hundred years is ‘only’?” “You’re so young, Tirity! But yes, it is little for a complete cognitive evolution. Most hard trainers can prolong it to a couple of hundred years. They even get to call the wind or grow a giant plant that could touch the clouds. But voicing everything in the universe? I think only God can do it, the God who created everything with only words. And if God created the world so that he could see how far the humans can evolve, then I’d say, yes, even a human could get godly power. Godlier than voicing one or two elements. If. Given. The. Time.”“How much time?” “More than thousands of years, maybe. Could even need millions, who knows? …”TJ smiles drily; she remembers how her eyes sparkled at the thought of becoming a goddess who could voice everything. She dreamed of flying in the air or walking in space. She thought of making her own garden full of giant flowers where only enormous butterflies would dance. Some days, when she played video games in VR, she even dreamed of voicing the thunder and lightning to join her wooden sword. She thought time could help her do it.

The scholar struggles for the benefit of all humanity, sometimes to reduce physical effort, sometimes to reduce pain, and sometimes to postpone death, or at least render it more bearable. In contrast, the patriot sacrifices a rather substantial part of humanity for the sake of his own prestige. His statue is always erected on a pedestal of ruins and corpses... In contrast, all humanity crowns a scholar, love forms the pedestal of his statues, and his triumphs defy the desecration of time and the judgment of history.” ― Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Advice for a Young Investigator"},{"quote":"“Everyone thinks that the old days were better, or that they were harder, and the modern times are chaotic and complex, or easier all around, but I think people's hearts have always been the same, happy and sad, and that hasn't changed at all.

People changed slowly, over time. You didn't take one step, then find yourself in a completely new location. You first took a little step off the path to avoid some rocks. For a while, you walked alongside the path, but then you wandered out a little way to step on softer soil. Then you stopped paying attention as you drifted farther and farther away. Finally, you found yourself in the wrong city, wondering why the signs on the roadway hadn't led you better.” ― Brandon Sanderson, The Emperor's Soul"},{"quote":"“The past may or may not be a foreign country. It may morph or lie still, but its capital is always Regret, and what flushes through it is the grand canal of unfledged desires that feed into an archipelago of tiny might-have-beens that never really happened but aren't unreal for not happening and might still happen though we fear they never will. And I thought of Ole Brit holding back so much, as we all do when we look back to see that the roads we've left behind or not taken have all but vanished. Regret is how we hope to back into our real lives once we find the will, the blind drive and courage, to trade in the life we're given for the life that bears our name and ours only. Regret is how we look forward to things we've long lost yet never really had. Regret is hope without conviction, I said. We're torn between regret, which is the price to pay for things not done, and remorse, which is the cost for having done them. Between one and the other, time plays all its cozy little tricks.” ― André Aciman, Enigma Variations"},{"quote":"“It doesn't really matter if you are left behind the back, but what matters is your capacity to pull and push everyone by your way to get to the front.” ― Michael Bassey Johnson"},{"quote":"“Time wounds all heals.” ― Tracy Letts, August: Osage County"},{"quote":"“Parsifal is on his way to the temple of the Grail Knights and says: “I hardly move, yet far I seem to have come”, and the all-knowing Gurnemanz replies: “You see, my son, time turns here into space” ― Richard Wagner"},{"quote":"“Some people say they have 20 years experience, when in reality, they have 1 year's experience repeated 20 times.

And since this temporal state cannot possess its life completely and simultaneously, but it does, in the same manner, exist forever without ceasing, it therefore seems to try in some degree to rival that which it cannot fulfill or represent, for it binds itself to some sort of present time out of this small and fleeting moment; but inasmuch as this temporal present bears a certain appearance of that abiding present, it somehowmakes those, to whom it comes, seem to be in truth what they imitate. But since this imitation could not be abiding, the unending march of time has swept it away, and thus we find that it has bound together, as it passes, a chain of life, which it could not by abiding embrace in its fullness.

But it really was a horse, and its eyes rolled and there was foam at its mouth and its breathing was painful to hear. I saw then that he wore his blade slung across his back, for its haft protruded high above his right shoulder. Still slowing, eyes fixed upon me, he departed the road, bearing slightly toward my left, jerked the reins once and released them, keeping control of the horse with his knees. His left hand went up in a salute-like movement that passed above his head and seized the hilt of his weapon. It came free without a sound, describing a beautiful arc above him and coming to rest in a lethal position out from his left shoulder and slanting back, like a single wing of dull steel with a minuscule line of edge that gleamed like a filament of mirror. The picture he presented was burned into my mind with a kind of magnificence, a certain splendor that was strangely moving. The blade was a long, scythe like affair that I had seen him use before. Only then we had stood as allies against a mutual foe I had begun to believe unbeatable. Benedict had proved otherwise that night.

And what can little men do with their spades, ditches, and pails? The forest is no more, it was devoured by fire: stumps and ash. Perhaps illimitable fields will be plowed here one day, perhaps some new, unheard-of wheat will ripen here and men from Arkansas with shaven faces will weigh in their palms the heavy golden grain. Or perhaps a city will grow up-alive with ringing sound and motion, all stone and crystal and iron-and winged men will come here flying over seas and mountains from all ends of the world. But never again the forest, never again the blue winter silence and the golden silence of summer. And only the tellers of tales will speak in many-colored patterned words about what had been, about wolves and bears and stately green-coated century-old grandfathers, about old Russia; they will speak about all this to us who have seen it with our own eyes ten years - a hundred years! - ago, and to those others, the winged ones, who will come in a hundred years to listen and to marvel at it all as at a fairy tale.

Time had fascinated her from childhood, its apparent power to move at different speeds, the dissolution it wrought on minds and bodies, her sense that each moment, all moments past and those to come, were fused into an illusory present which with every breath became the unalterable, indestructible past. In the City of London these moments were caught and solidified in stone and brick, in churches and monuments and in bridges which spanned the grey-brown ever-flowing Thames. She would walk out in spring or summer as early as six o'clock, double-locking the front door behind her, stepping into a silence more profound and mysterious than the absence of noise.

I'm no expert in the history of religions, and perhaps this is nothing new--do you happen to know if there was ever a belief in an...imperfect God?''What do you mean by imperfect?' Snow frowned. 'In a way all the gods of the old religions were imperfect, considered that their attributes were amplified human ones. The God of the Old Testament, for instance, required humble submission and sacrifices, and and was jealous of other gods. The Greek gods had fits of sulks and family quarrels, and they were just as imperfect as mortals...''No,' I interrupted. 'I'm not thinking of a god whose imperfection arises out of the candor of his human creators, but one whose imperfection represents his essential characteristic: a god limited in his omniscience and power, fallible, incapable of foreseeing the consequences of his acts, and creating things that lead to horror. He is a...sick god, whose ambitions exceed his powers and who does not realize it at first. A god who has created clocks, but not the time they measure.

For your god, the divine condition is a situation without a goal. And understanding that, he despairs. But isn't this despairing god of yours mankind, Kelvin? Is it man you are talking about, and that is a fallacy, not just philosophically but also mystically speaking.'I kept on:'No, it's nothing to do with man. man may correspond to my provisional definition from some point of view, but that is because the definition has a lot of gaps. Man does not create gods, in spite of appearances. The times, the age, impose them on him. Man can serve is age or rebel against it, but the target of his cooperation or rebellion comes to him from outside. If there was only a since human being in existence, he would apparently be able to attempt the experiment of creating his own goals in complete freedom--apparently, because a man not brought up among other human beings cannot become a man. And the being--the being I have in mind--cannot exist in the plural, you see? ...Perhaps he has already been born somewhere, in some corner of the galaxy, and soon he will have some childish enthusiasm that will set him putting out one star and lighting another.

Time loses meaning because primary identity shifts into alignment with the timeless principle itself. Distance in space loses felt degrees of separation, because of deep interconnectivity in its undifferentiated formless state. Death loses significance because it is perceived and experienced as another transformation of the Dao. Anxiety from change dissipates, as it is simply seen as part of Dao’s process of equilibrium. The intolerance of uncertainty fades, as it gives way to the adventure of potential and possibility. It is, in essence, alongside chance, the requirement for freedom. The Dao is self-generating, meaning it is root and branch. It is complete fulfillment, so temptations surrender their grasp to Dao’s quiescence. In a sense, to be with Dao is to favor loss over gain.” ― Aldrich Chan, 7 Principles of Nature: How We Strayed and How We Return"},{"quote":"“Pest Control in Maynard MA | 844-817-0084Are you searching for trusted and professional Pest Control in Maynard MA?

He can exist in time, where we ordinarily exist. To exist in time is bound to bring death. There is birth and there is death. Man can also exist in eternity, where there is no birth and no death. Mind moves in time in sequence. Time is linear, andmoes from point A to point B. Work is done by the mindwhich is why the universities, the schools and the colleges train your mind, because society needs skilled workers. Eternity represents meditation. Meditation means to jump out of the mind. It means learning to be absolutely inactive and doing nothing for a few moments. You have only to sit silently, doing nothing, and everything goes on happening of its own accord. Meditation is not something that has to be done, it is something that has to be understood. If you understand meditation then that is enough. Then you can sit anywhere and fall into meditativeness. Meditation is not action, but a state of silence, a state of inaction where everything stops. Time stops, movement stops and you are in a total rest. And those are the moments when you know that you are immortal. You know that the body will die, but you are not going to die. Then all fears disappear, because all fears are rooted in death. And to be fearless is the most fundamental thing for living joyously. The fearful person cannot live joyously. He cannot love, because he is afraid. Meditation is learning to be adventurous, always ready to go into the unknown and always ready to explore that which is not known. He is always ready to take risks, because he knows that there is no death, so there is no fear. Then to live dangerously is playful. This depends on one thing: that one has some experience of one's immortality. It depends on the experience that \"I was never born and I will never die.\" This is possible through meditation. A meditator has to learn to do only the essential in life and not waste one's life on doing the non-essentials. You need to learn what is important and meaningful in life. A meditator has to learn how to relax, how to rest and enjoy rest. And slowly one settles into one's inner being, into one's own centre, and the moment you touch your centre you touch eternity, timelessness, That is what meditation is: an exploration of eternity. ” ― Swami Dhyan Giten, The Way of the Heart"},{"quote":"“If one wishes to be instructed-not that anyone does-concerning the treacherous role that memory plays in human life, consider how relentlessly the water of memory refuses to break, how it impedes that journey into the air of time.

There is talk of literal highway robbery. (Our Cro-Magnon governor denies any of this is happening, even though there are reports that some of these forces are amassing in his name.) For the time being, I can ghostwrite my books and shop specials at the grocery and take my niece to the water park, but no one knows how much longer this version of our world will last. “Sometimes I can’t believe a place like this exists,” my husband says as we speed down a gleaming white limestone road that cuts through a palm forest, or ride an airboat around a swollen lake.

In that relaxed moment, satori, samadhi, enlightenment is possible.You attain to enlightenment only when there is no ego to demand - there is no demand, there is no demander.Time creates the ego. The ego does not exist in animals because they are not conscious of time.The ego does not exist in children because they are also not conscious of time. When you become conscious of time you become conscious of many things. First, the consciousness of time creates the fear of death. You immediately become conscious of death.Time and death, they are not separate at all. The moment you become alert about time you become alert about death because time is running out fast, death is coming, death is there and you have to do something before death grabs you. Then fear, anxiety....In that fear and anxiety, in that impatience, you can go on searching but you will not find. It is not that you have to find God, it is that you have to allow him to find you. So you have to be in a receptive mood, in a non-desiring, non-demanding mood, utterly at ease, as if it has already happened. There is no need for it to happen, it is as if it has already happened.

Time, then, is told by love’s losses, and by the coming of love, and by love continuing in gratitude for what is lost. It is folded and enfolded and unfolded forever and ever, the love by which the dead are alive and the unborn welcomed into the womb. The great question for the old and the dying, I think, is not if they have loved and been loved enough, but if they have been grateful enough for love received and given, however much.

Dying I learned the futility and temporary nature of hatred, ranged as it is against the permanence of love. Though fear and hatred are the flashiest and sometimes the most powerful human emotions, they are merely the hare facing off against the tortoise of love. Love slowly, quietly, and patiently waits for hate to simply burn out. It requires so much more energy to hate than to love, and love has all the time in the world.

It is not that they really bring happiness, nor that anyone imagines that true bliss comes from possessing the money to be won at gaming or the hare that is hunted: no one would take it as a gift. What people want is not the easy peaceful life that allows us to think of our unhappy condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the burdens of office, but the agitation that takes our mind off it and diverts us. That is why we prefer the hunt to the capture.That is why men are so fond of hustle and bustle; that is why prison is such a fearful punishment; that is why the pleasures of solitude are so incomprehensible. That, in fact, is the main joy of being a king, because people are continually trying to divert him and stop him thinking about himself, because, king though he is, he becomes unhappy as soon as he thinks about himself.That is all that men have been able to devise for attaining happiness; those who philosophize about it, holding that people are quite unreasonable to spend all day chasing a hare that they would not have wanted to buy, have little knowledge of our nature.

People feel that if the universe was personal it would vary; if the sun were alive it would dance. This is a fallacy even in relation to known fact. For the variation in human affairs is generally brought into them, not by life, but by death; by the dying down or breaking off of their strength or desire. A man varies his movements because of some slight element of failure or fatigue. He gets into an omnibus because he is tired of walking; or he walks because he is tired of sitting still. But if his life and joy were so gigantic that he never tired of going to Islington, he might go to Islington as regularly as the Thames goes to Sheerness. The very speed and ecstacy of his life would have the stillness of death. The sun rises every morning. I do not rise every morning; but the variation is due not to my activity, but to my inaction. Now, to put the matter in a popular phrase, it might be true that the sun rises regularly because he never gets tired of rising. His routine might be due, not to a lifelessness, but to a rush of life. The thing I mean can be seen, for instance, in children, when they find some game or joke that they specially enjoy. A child kicks his legs rhythmically through excess, not absence, of life. Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, “Do it again”; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead. For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony. But perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony. It is possible that God says every morning, “Do it again” to the sun; and every evening, “Do it again” to the moon. It may not be automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike; it may be that God makes every daisy separately, but has never got tired of making them.

And yet we've surrounded ourselves with reminders of that loss of freedom—by hanging clocks on walls and dotting them around our houses.

We've even felt the need to wrap our bodies up in time by going so far as to wrap it around our wrists.But now I think I'm beginning to understand.

Her gaze cuts through the dark, dismissive and haunted all at once... What does she know that I do not!?I stood beneath the canopy of brittle air, the breath of a wind too muffled to matter pressing against my ear. The quietude of the season lodged itself deep, threading through marrow and thought alike. Somewhere distant, the faint call of an owl spilled across the night, shearing the imperturbable, and I realized this lull was not still, not empty. It swelled, pressed, expanded... an ache without center, scattering itself like seeds into the pit of me.For a moment, I thought I heard it... a hum, soft and glacial, as if the world itself were breathing from a great, aching hollow.

The fi rst time is the reversible, clockwork time of the classical age, when no fundamental law was thought to dictate the direction of time’s flow. The second time is the globally entropic time of the second law of thermodynamics, of Carnot’s heat engine that carries everything towards death. This thermodynamic principle was formalised in 1865 by Rudolph Clausius who, drawing heavily on Carnot’s work on heat engines, coined the term ‘entropy’ to describe the irrecoverable heat inevitably lost from any mechanical system. Laplace brings this irreversible time into the natural sciences with a cosmogony that supplements Newton’s reversible cosmology with a dimension of becoming (JVSH 36), and Darwin inscribes irreversible time at the heart of the natural sciences (JVSH 39). The eternal universe of Pascal is no more: ‘Immersed in time the universe likewise is born, develops, evolves, wears out and, perhaps, will die’ (JVSH 36).133 Time enters into science. The third time is the locally negentropic time of codes and information, preserving complexity against the general decay of order (H4 287).134 The idea of negentropy was developed in the 1930s, describing a pocket of information preserved in a wider context of entropic decay (see JVSH 136). It is a time encrusted in the living beings who ‘follow an evolution that Bergson called creative, of which we can at least say that it runs in the opposite direction to the thermodynamic arrow’ (H5 79) (Watkin 2020: 132)” ― Christopher Watkin, Michel Serres: Figures of Thought"},{"quote":"“We desire to make this day a long one, since we can't have your master with us long.” ― Onoto Watanna, A Japanese Blossom"},{"quote":"“There were many things in the world, waiting for a rare opportunity.

According to the Vedic philosophy, Kaali signifies ‘Kaal’. In Sanskrit; kaal has two meanings :1. Time. (like—kaal kya hoga)2. Darkness. (like—Kaala kaaua)Now, why does ‘kaal’ signify both of these?Because, the Time is inseparable to the Space.The space is Dark. So the time is also considered as Dark. The “Kaala”. That’s why ‘kaal’ has two meanings; Darkness, and Time; in Sanskrit.There is no separate time, and separate space. Time is the fourth dimension of this universe along with three-dimensional space. The space exists; because time exists simultaneously with it.Kali is considered as the symbol of this time-space; the ultimate structure of the world—and this is why it is portrayed as dark; just like the space-time in reality, is dark.The violent and horrific form was portrayed of Kaali; because Kaali is the symbol of ‘kaal’, the time; and Time is unforgiving. Time is horrible by its nature. We all know how bad time can be. Time takes everyone to the death eventually; time destroys everything in the end. Time doesn’t take into account of who you are; time doesn’t take into account of how big you are or what your value is, be good or bad; each and everything has an end in the realm of time; and each and everything recedes ultimately in the ever engulfing mouth of the Time.This is the reason; death is portrayed all around the Kaali. The decapitated heads of demons; the bloods all around. All symbolize the death. The ending. The mortality of everything. Not of evil only; but of everything. It’s just, the evils are first in the line of death.And that tongue sticking out of her mouth symbolize—that the hunger of Kaali (the time) is never filled up. That tongue is always ready to savor the next death; the next destruction; the next ending of something. This stuck-out tongue is a reminder to the viewer; the hunger of ‘Kaal’ is not filled yet; and the next person she is going to savour can be you. In no way you can resist her for eternity; and in no way you can escape her. And she relishes licking out your death. It’s her duty; and amusement both.This is the reason why Kaali’s tongue was made stuck-out while portraying her in Vedic Scriptures.There is no clothing portrayed on Kaali; because— Time also shows you the nude reality. Time is rough, tough, rude, and nude. It speaks bluntly. Both good times and bad times comes without warning; and may go without warning too. Time does not know or follow politeness. Time does not follow any protocol.Time has nothing to ‘hide’ from you. Because she knows; in the end, whoever you are, you are all hers.Time holds each and everything in this universe in its womb. The creation happened; only because it has got a ‘time-space’ dimension for it. For anything to exist; Time has to produce it by creating a space for it. Time is also the destroyer of the all things; but time also creates everything; and holds everything within the eternal flow of her.That’s why time is considered as feminine. Time is a female who gives birth to its children; bears it for a while; and then takes them back again on her embracing lap. While singing the lullaby of the funeral; she gives her children the most peaceful eternal sleep for of their life : the Death.Life is beautiful; only because it has a time-limit to it. Without the time-limit imposed by the death; life is a prolonged disaster only.This is why; Time was considered as Mother in Vedic Culture.

Each morning, as the sun peeks over the horizon, we all receive the same precious allotment: 24 hours, 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds. No more, no less.The billionaire in their penthouse and the street vendor below both wake to this same gift. The young student and the elderly sage share this identical treasure. It cannot be hoarded, cannot be saved, cannot be borrowed against future days. Time flows ever forward, spending itself whether we will it or not.What separates us, then, is not the quantity of time we receive, but the wisdom with which we spend it. Some invest these hours in pursuit of knowledge, letting each minute compound into greater understanding. Others spend lavishly on creation, turning time into art, music, or innovation. Some give their hours generously to others, transforming time into love, care, and connection.Yet it's easy to become a poor steward of this universal wealth. Minutes slip away on mindless distractions. Hours evaporate in the fog of procrastination. Days can be squandered on pursuits that bring neither joy nor growth. Unlike money, misspent time can never be earned back.The most profound truth about time is this: its value is determined not by its passage, but by its purpose. A single hour spent in passionate creation may be worth more than a day spent in listless consumption. A few minutes of genuine connection might outweigh weeks of shallow interaction.The challenge before us is not to control time – for that is impossible – but to be mindful of its passing and intentional in its use.

Each Kali Yuga ends with a great flood (pralaya) that destroys the world, only to start afresh with a new Satya Yuga. Some Hindus argue that Vaishnavites and Shaivites differ in their perception of time; after all, Vishnu is reincarnated in various avatars, while Shiva simply ‘is’.

Still, based on this deduction or inference, we cannot prove that what is curved is space since nothing remains nothing and cannot be transformed into something based on the laws of physics. If the Nothing does not convert into something, the curvature of space is impossible. To prove the curvature of nothing (space), we must prove that nothing can transform itself into something based on the laws of physics.Suppose we further insist that this is only a problem of linguistics and philosophy and not physics since we stated that space is how we define it and not as it is. This reasoning would be insufficient because we must first prove that actual space is what it is and not what we say it is to fit our arguments. There can be no answers to the most critical questions of contemporary science, physics, philosophy, and even religions if we are not as precise as possible, linguistically, experimentally, or in any other way. These questions appear to be self-evident, self-explanatory truths and axioms, yet they are neither self-evident nor clear and precise to reflect the actual underlying reality. If we are not as precise as possible, we create theories and paradigms presented as facts, although the starting premises are undefined and unanswered. However, if we do not answer the starting causes and premises, we cannot adequately describe the laws of nature, nor can we understand them.Regardless of how sure we are about space and the curvature of space, we still cannot claim we are correct without describing the nature of nothing. Without the Nothing, there can be no space. There will be an immediate argument, though, that the Nothing has no nature and, therefore, there is nothing to describe. The answer is that its passivity and lack of properties are its most potent “property” because they enable creation and existence. Without the Nothing or void, there is no creation and no existence.We converted nothing into something by our thoughts and language, using deduction or inference, and concluded that space is the consequence of this thought process, not the actual process. We applied our definite language to our indefinite “understanding,” ideas, or reasoning to prove the “fact.” However, the fact is or is not, regardless of our ideas, language, or reasoning.We must use the opposite and apply language to the facts rather than our understanding. Our understanding is limited, and facts are impersonal and independent of our knowledge. We cannot falsify the language to fit and understand the facts better. We cannot change facts or affect them with our ideas, but facts are verifiable up to a point. There are facts beyond the verifiable point by humans since human beings are limited. Still, language is verifiable, and our theories are both falsifiable and verifiable to a large extent.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Since the immaterial Being envelopes the Nothing, this nothing, in “cooperation” with the Universal Being (Mind), becomes space as we experience and describe it. The “fabric” of this created space, with the help of nothingness, is curved. But all this is the product of the transformation of the Being into its different forms, modes, and interdependent qualities of reality. The “material” world is only a symphony of “materialized” qualities of the Universal Being,” not matter per se because matter per se does not exist. What we see as space is a “materialized” program of the Universal Mind. What appears to us as dimensions is the underlying nothingness holding the illusion of Reality, making it appear material. The Primordial Primary Quality is the Primary Ultimate Force, or Source, that powers all we see, experience, and measure. Everything is related to Everything else and is affected and conditioned by Everything else. Everything within the Universe is a message, information, and code to everything else. Energy and matter are the messages of the Universal Mind sent into nothingness to fertilize it. Relationships and communication among the myriad beings are the life of one organism. All the features of matter we experience are real in the sense that we experience the spacetime continuum, but all that is the result of programming and conditioning rather than energy and matter as physical realities per se. Everything was One and became a multitude, yet Everything stayed One on the most basic level. The story of One is the story of All. Every sense, every pain, and everything we feel are the messages of existence, messages of the Universal Mind in action, interconnecting the Web of the Universe into One Family. Absolute is the Ultimate uniting force of Everything. To be one and only is death. That’s why creating is needed. Without creating, there is no life. The Universe is the life of the Absolute. Something and Nothing are the Father and the Mother of the World. From One Absolute, there is an almost endless family dispersed through space in search of life and meaning, which is what we call existence.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“The whole past, the present, and the future are in the world as potential. Without space, there is no growth and time. Growth and development are possible only in the multitude, which implies distances and is not accidental. Even if the beginning was accidental, and it was not, growth and development are not. A compressed idea, the primordial Universal Mind, contains the Way and every dimension. Time is the measure of distance; time beats from its heart and records the motion of its bloodstream; time turns the pages of the Way and epitomizes the unmistakable memory of the Being-God. Time is the Being’s device with which it deceives the emptiness within itself. Time records and glorifies the glory of the Being-God.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Since both past and present are in the Primordial Being, he has already walked his way; he will not arrive at any other time or have more or less time. He will return to the same “place” simultaneously, beyond time. He swims outside time and seeks and offers the purpose through the artifice of time. No particle is aware of its most profound memory. However, every particle rushes through time in its unmistakable walk, and every mistake is part of this unmistakable walk, part of its perfection.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Life has no meaning without the past and future; the present, without the past and the future, is the frozen moment. We all fight for the present, but if anything exists in time, that is the past and the future. Is it possible to measure the present? How long does it last? The present second is not the present: before we think about it, it becomes the future; when we think about it, it becomes the past, and the future becomes the past in the exact second. (This is a good argument about particles and waves since we cannot determine a particle’s exact position and momentum.) What time is there in the present? Only the Absolute is in the absolute present because the absolute present is timeless and spaceless. The present is eternity, and eternity is nothing.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“If we divide the second, every fraction becomes the past faster than the speed of thought and every fraction of every fraction.

The whole matter is smaller than the numberless “number” of infinity. Infinity is endless.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Even endless knowledge of the Universal Mind cannot sustain infinity as actuality. The Universal Mind cannot transform into an absolute plurality of infinity. Its purpose is to transform from one into many and to exist meaningfully. The meaning and the purpose of the Universal Mind are saved based on this limit imposed by something without any limit, the infinity.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Real endlessness, absolute multitude, and variance imply an accident or the impossibility of an accident, which boils down to the same. Absolute multitude and endlessness can exist only in emptiness. The Home of endlessness and the multitude is Zero. We have to reach the bottom of a second, the bottom of time, to pass through the whole multitude and “infinity” to catch the present. Nevertheless, it is impossible to catch the present because it is Zero. Over time, the future becomes the past at the edge of Zero. The present is the annihilation of life; the present does not exist, but Everything is the presence of an organism that remembers and breathes according to its program—the present is the eternity it tries to avoid. All the rest implies some motion or illusion; it resembles eternity because it has eternal life.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Zero is the enslaved time, enslaved past, and future in the present of Zero. Zero is the end of recording: the time that contains all time and an absolute multitude within itself. Time, an eternity, is smaller than a moment, than a second, than a fraction of a second; it is not measurable. Time does not exist. Eternity does not have measure; its only measure is Zero, into which it goes to sleep. That is why an instant is longer than an eternity: an instant has a duration.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“Zero enslaves space and time when a compressed idea, the Universal Mind, explodes into itself through emptiness; when a compressed idea, the mind converts and irrupts into countless ideas (messages). Creation of space is the classification and ordering of ideas (information), not division or motion but development, birth, and happening, the life of an idea, and development of the musical scale. Space is the trembling of emptiness: the life of a mind that listens to itself.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“There is no time and space. Motion is a Sisyphus’ stone, and space is emptiness, which is nothing. Zero enslaves the space within itself, leaving emptiness without space out of itself. Zero frees the space from the condensed idea, offering the emptiness to spread within the compressed mind. The enslavement of emptiness is the birth of space. Freedom of emptiness is her slavery. Emptiness becomes the slave and the master; obeying God, the vacuum gives him birth, in a way, by providing space for plurality, but simultaneously enlivens itself.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“God is Sisyphus, and existence (life) is the stone.

The Universal Mind is the active “pole,” and the Absolute Void (Nothingness) is the passive “pole.” At the “moment” of creation, the Universal Mind envelops nothingness by the size of its program, but there is always nothingness “beyond” this nothingness unaffected by the creation. There can be many of these creations or universes. All of them together form the Universe. The Universe we live in is only a speck of the real Universe we cannot identify based on our current technology. It is a big question whether we will ever be able to glimpse the Absolute except through abstract thought and imagination, which are, in my opinion, legitimate methods not only of philosophical investigation but also scientific ones.” ― Dejan Stojanovic, ABSOLUTE"},{"quote":"“So the year went on, a dark year, though now each day had that one bright hour at its dawn.” ― Ursula K.

Our habit of breaking up time into the past, present and future does not entitle us to endow the last with more reality than the first. From the standpoint of the present, the future is no richer in reality than the past, and our efforts should be with reference, not to the future, but to that eternal present of which both future and past are one.

But there is no room in terrestrial reality, by its nature strictly confined and limited, for an absolute life. Yet the Utopia theory asserts that what has been impossible until now will not be so always, that an absolute and conclusive state will sooner or later crown historical relations. It affirms, not a transition from limited historical relations to some other plane of being, to some fourth dimension commensurable with the closed three dimensional world, but a fourth dimension of absolute life within the very framework of three-dimensional space. In this lie its fundamental metaphysical antithesis and essential instability, instead of seeing absolute life as the transition from terrestrial to, celestial history, it presupposes an ultimate solution of human destiny within the framework of terrestrial relations, a final integration of the three-dimensional world. It desires to humanize that absolute perfection and beatitude which can only be attained in the celestial reality and only contained in the fourth dimension.” ― Nicolas Berdyaev, The Meaning of History"},{"quote":"“As I observe the passage of time, I find an increasing appreciation for the concept of departure from this realm, not from a place of sorrow, but rather from an evolving sense of disconnection from a civilization that appears to be loosening its hold on intellect and decorum. The vernacular and idioms humans employ are shifting, less focused on the conveyance of ideas and more on the provocation of reaction or disdain. It is perplexing to witness linguistic constructs, across various tongues like Spanish, being repurposed not for their original intent but as subtle derogations. My aversion has always been towards the trivialization of language through vulgarity or derision masquerading as cleverness, particularly when it belittles or scoffs. Once, I entertained notions of altering the societal fabric, aspiring to refine the dialogue, yet now I grasp the insight in transforming one's own essence instead.

The statue was duly unveiled, and there under the left foot of the scientist was an overgrown lizard being crushed to death. I wonder if that excellent scholar ever thought what it all meant. Of course, it represented science destroying the bad influence of ignorance. But did the scientist realize that he was the direct successor of Enlil, Marduk, Ashur, Jehovah, and St. George? As I was contemplating that statue, a thought passed through my mind: who will fight the dragon next?

Hence it is, that, when the deed is done, when the work of darkness is perfect, then the world of darkness passes away like a pageantry in the clouds: the knocking at the gate is heard; and it makes known audibly that the reaction has commenced: the human has made its reflux upon the fiendish; the pulses of life are beginning to beat again...” ― Thomas de Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater & Other Writings"},{"quote":"“We are remarkably primitive, compared to Um-Helat.

In this way, we may keep track of the physical cycles like the shift of the sun, the moon, the stars, and the seasons.

(I hope the reader is now convinced!)Well, what does pass, then? I shall argue that it is the conscious awareness of the fleeting self that changes from moment to moment. The misconception that time flows or passes can be traced back to the tacit assumption of a conserved self. It is natural for people to think that ‘they’ endure from moment to moment while the world changes because ‘time flows’. But as Alice remarked in Lewis Carroll’s story, ‘It’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.’ Alice was right: ‘you’ are not the same today as you were yesterday. To be sure, there is a very strong correlation – a lot of mutual information, to get technical about it – between today’s you and yesterday’s you – a thread of information made up of memories and beliefs and desires and attitudes and other things that usually change only slowly, creating an impression of continuity. But continuity is not conservation. There are future yous correlated with (that is, observing) future states of the world, and past yous correlated with (observing) past states of the world. At each moment, the you appropriate to that world-state interprets the correlation with that state as ‘now’. It is indeed ‘now’ for ‘that you’ at ‘that time’. That’s all!The flow-of-time phenomenon reveals ‘the self’ as a slowly evolving complex pattern of stored information that can be accessed at later times and provide an informational template against which fresh perceptions can be matched. The illusion of temporal flow stems from the inevitable slight mismatches.” ― Paul C.W.

As an oracle of fear I remembered that great Roman warning, Nessit vox missa reverti (that a word once uttered is irrevocable), a freezing arrest upon the motions of hope too sanguine that haunted me in many shapes. Long before that fifteenth year of mine, I had noticed, as a worm lying at the heart of life and fleeting its security, the fact that innumerable acts of choice change countenance and are variously appraised at varying stage of life - shift with the shifting hours. Already at fifteen, I had become deeply ashamed of judgements which I had once pronounced, of idle hopes that I had once encouraged, false admirations or contempts with which once I had sympathized.

Time does not seem to matter to things like triangles or tripods because their qualities are either timeless or eternal. A future triangle would be like any triangle past or present. Truth, in other words, seems either to eradicate time or, at least, to take the temporality out of time. In the terms that Hegel began to establish, Kant’s disquieting claim about the injustice built into time, history, and progress began to look more surmountable. On one side, there was a world made up of moments, some present, some past, some future. The future would turn into the present and negate itself. The present would turn into the past but could still be available in the present. The passage of time and the endless stream of negations of negations built into the human ability to make choices and decisions would give rise to many diferent values, arrangements, and worldviews. Some, however, might turn out to be true. This was the hallmark of the other side of human history. If something was true, it would fall out of time and become, simply, timeless.

I guess it's always about the Time, the guardian of this Journey that we have to wait and persevere, that we have to remain resilient in the resolve to walk ahead, to find some way to hold on to the voyage, to not let the ship sink in the hollows of a mirage, to just live. And that is what Life is about, perhaps to know that Gloom and Melancholy is a distinct part of our journey, and actually something that occupies the most part of our journey, and it doesn't have to be a deep Grief it can simply be the mundane sorrow of carrying on this existence knowing that Life is just a short frame holding dark colours as much as the bright ones, sometimes even more of those blackness only to bring out the whites a little bit more. And while all of this goes on, somewhere our heart would know that there is One who is beyond this frame of Life and the space of Time and Cosmos; who is always holding your hand giving you the breath to walk ahead. May be He doesn't take away the blackness but throughout stays firm in your path, holding your shadow and your soul ever so gently to make you become the Light that you could only possibly be by embracing all of your Soul's journey. He doesn't perhaps change the potholes in your way, but He does ensure that even when you tumble you don't end up falling and if you do fall, He makes sure that you rise all over again from the flames of Life's fire with the fury of a phoenix. He doesn't end your suffering but lets you see that throughout your pain He is partaking in an even greater portion of it, alongside you. Simple, He doesn't let you see that He is God, because He shares your Life as a companion, walking beside you hand in hand, to make you live all that your soul had contracted before this journey began and even when He is beyond Time, He lets Time be your friend in a journey that is bound in human flesh and guarded by the tick-tock of that guardian. So when I asked my Soul, what is that troubles me the most, I heard my Soul, Smile in a safe knowledge, when I have Him, need I let my troubles concern me? My heart knew, He has already tucked my mind in the tranquil world of Life's paint-brush and a rainbow is just around the corner. A distant yet distinct rainbow. A rainbow that is churned in Love, the love that only He can provide, the Love that is always lurking on the edges of those clouds and rain, in the silhouette of a rainbow forever promised on the other side of a thunderstorm.

That's why negativity into a negative feedback loop is a self-consumptive process which ultimately exhausts itself, whereas positivity into positive feedback loop is the essential form of continual growth. Conscious entities have a special affinity for positive feedback loops due to our fractal nature.
