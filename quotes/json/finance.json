To the economist embezzlement is the most interesting of crimes. Alone among the various forms of larceny it has a time parameter. Weeks, months, or years may elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery. (This is a period, incidentally, when the embezzler has his gain and the man who has been embezzled, oddly enough, feels no loss. There is a net increase in psychic wealth.) At any given time there exists an inventory of undiscovered embezzlement in — or more precisely not in — the country’s businesses and banks. This inventory — it should perhaps be called the bezzle — amounts at any moment to many millions of dollars. It also varies in size with the business cycle. In good times people are relaxed, trusting, and money is plentiful. But even though money is plentiful, there are always many people who need more. Under these circumstances the rate of embezzlement grows, the rate of discovery falls off, and the bezzle increases rapidly. In depression all this is reversed. Money is watched with a narrow, suspicious eye. The man who handles it is assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise. Audits are penetrating and meticulous. Commercial morality is enormously improved. The bezzle shrinks.…Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth, so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery. Within a few days, something close to a universal trust turned into something akin to universal suspicion. Audits were ordered. Strained or preoccupied behavior was noticed. Most important, the collapse in stock values made irredeemable the position of the employee who had embezzled to play the market.

Whether you are an adult content creator, a fitness instructor, or an influencer exploring subscription-based income, the key to unlocking earnings on OnlyFans is having a verified account. Verification ensures you can legally receive payments, maintain compliance with platform regulations, and present a professional, trustworthy profile to your audience. For many creators, waiting for verification or submitting personal identification documents can feel risky or time-consuming. This is why thousands of creators, agencies, and digital entrepreneurs in 2025 are choosing to Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts — fully verified, clean-record accounts ready for instant content launch.Buying a verified account is not just about convenience; it is a strategic decision that provides privacy, security, and a fast track to monetization. When you purchase a verified account, you immediately gain access to features like paid subscriptions, pay-per-view content, tips, and messaging. This allows you to start earning from day one, without compromising your personal identity or risking delays in approval. Reputable providers such as Royalty Hive ensure that every account they offer is fully verified, has a clean history, and is optimized for immediate monetization.Why Verified OnlyFans Accounts Are Crucial for CreatorsVerification on OnlyFans is mandatory for anyone who wants to monetize content. Without it, you cannot withdraw earnings, enable subscriptions, or offer paid content. Traditional verification processes involve submitting government-issued identification, proof of address, and a facial scan. While these steps are essential for platform security, they create several challenges:Privacy Risks – Submitting personal ID links your legal identity to an adult-content platform permanently.Time Delays – Verification can take days or even weeks, causing lost revenue opportunities.Rejection Chances – IDs may be rejected due to small errors, poor photo quality, or system flags, requiring resubmission.By choosing to Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts, creators bypass these issues entirely. Accounts purchased from trusted providers are pre-approved and fully compliant with OnlyFans regulations. This means you can focus on creating and promoting content rather than navigating bureaucratic hurdles.Privacy Protection: Keep Your Identity SafeOne of the primary benefits of buying a verified account is privacy protection. Your personal identity, legal name, and banking information remain separate from your OnlyFans profile. This is especially important for creators who wish to maintain discretion due to professional, personal, or social reasons.A verified account purchased from a reputable provider ensures:No personal data exposure – The identity used for verification does not belong to you.Secure login credentials – Accounts are delivered with secure credentials, which you can change upon receipt.Clean record history – Trusted providers ensure the account has no previous bans or violations.Privacy-conscious creators can therefore operate freely, upload content, and interact with their audience without fear of personal data leaks or unwanted attention.Fast Monetization: Start Earning ImmediatelyTiming is critical in digital content monetization. Trend cycles on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter move rapidly. Missing even a few days of revenue opportunities can significantly impact earnings.” ― Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts – Verified ID, Clean Record & Ready for Instant Content Launch"},{"quote":"“Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts – The Ultimate Shortcut to Start Earning Safely in 2025Contact Royalty Hive**** WhatsApp: +1 (541) 223-1608 ******** Telegram: @royaltyhive **** **** Visit: royaltyhive.com ****Introduction:OnlyFans has transformed from a niche subscription site into a multi-billion-dollar earning machine for creators, agencies, and digital entrepreneurs worldwide. But in 2025, one major barrier still stops thousands of people from entering the platform — identity verification. To enable withdrawals and monetize content, OnlyFans forces every account owner to submit government ID, face scan, tax data, and banking details linked to their legal name. For anyone who values anonymity, occupational discretion, family privacy, or public reputation, that is a deal-breaker. This is why more and more people choose to Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts already approved and ready for instant monetization, instead of exposing their identity directly to the platform.Buying a pre-verified account removes the two biggest risks: (1) delayed verification and lost revenue timing and (2) permanent identity exposure connected to adult monetization. With a purchased ready-to-use account, you log in, brand it, upload content, and start earning the same day — without submitting your own ID. For agencies handling multiple performers, anonymity-valuing models, management firms, and privacy-focused individuals building a secondary income stream, purchasing a verified account is not a shortcut — it is the only professional, privacy-aligned entry strategy.Why Buying a Verified OnlyFans Account Is Safer Than Verifying YourselfWhen you verify directly with OnlyFans, you permanently attach your legal name, birthday, face, and banking trail to a platform associated with explicit or adult-rated content. Even if you later delete the account, the data is archived and never detached from your identity. That means if someone hacks, subpoenas, leaks, or audits the platform, your identity is forever traceable. Instead, when you Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts from a reputable provider, the identity on file is not yours — giving you operational freedom with legal and financial detachment. You control the brand, content, earnings, and withdrawals, but your personal identity is never part of the OnlyFans record.This identity separation is the reason agencies and high-privacy earners do not self-verify. They outsource identity risk by purchasing a verified shell account, then build on top of it. It is the same principle used in nominee banking, corporate structuring, and asset separation — the earner and the identity are legally distinct. In 2025, that is not just strategic; it is essential for reputation-protected income.The Earnings Speed Advantage of Buying Verified vs. Waiting for ApprovalTraditional verification can take 4–14 days, sometimes longer if the ID is rejected, flagged, or resubmitted. During that time, you cannot monetize, cannot send paid messages, cannot enable subscriptions, and cannot launch traffic campaigns. But traffic cycles on TikTok, Reddit, Telegram, Twitter, or paid promo have time sensitivity — when a momentum wave hits, you must convert instantly or lose it forever. That is why agencies who understand the economics of timing choose to Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts instead of leaving earnings on hold.One week of lost earnings at $200/day is $1,400 gone permanently — more than the cost of a verified account itself. So the commercial logic is simple: faster entry equals faster earnings. Delayed KYC equals burned opportunity.Professional Agencies Treat Verified Accounts as Digital AssetsFor professional managers running multiple creators, self-verifying every performer is high-risk, high-liability, and high-exposure. They maintain a portfolio of pre-verified assets — just like holding aged domains, warmed social accounts, or pre-approved payment profiles — and assign them as needed.” ― Buy Verified OnlyFans Accounts – The Ultimate Shortcut to Start Earning Safely in 2025"},{"quote":"“3 Fast Steps to Buy Verified Chime Accounts with Full AccessContact Royalty Hive today: ⏩ WhatsApp: +1 (541) 223-1608 ⏩ Telegram: @royaltyhive ⏩ Website: royaltyhive.comIntroduction: The Growing Demand for Verified Chime AccountsIn the fast-paced world of digital finance, users want banking solutions that are simple, secure, and accessible.

Landless and penniless, they were obliged to solicit loans from the landlords simply to find a way to eat—not for the money, since the sums were paltry, but because poor debtors were expected to pay back the interest in the form of work, which meant they were at least provided with food and shelter while they cleaned out their creditors’ outhouses and reroofed their sheds. For the “vanquished”—as for most people in the world, actually—the most significant life expenses were weddings and funerals. These required a good deal of money, which always had to be borrowed. In such cases it was common practice, Galey explains, for high-caste moneylenders to demand one of the borrower’s daughters as security. Often, when a poor man had to borrow money for his daughter’s marriage, the security would be the bride herself. She would be expected to report to the lender’s household after her wedding night, spend a few months there as his concubine, and then, once he grew bored, be sent off to some nearby timber camp, where she would have to spend the next year or two working as a prostitute to pay off her father’s debt.

However, by following the right steps, you can increase your chances of approval. Here’s how:1. Choose the Right LenderNot all banks have the same requirements. As a beginner, consider these options:• Credit Unions – Easier approval and lower interest rates.• Online Lenders – Quick application process and flexible requirements.• Secured Credit Cards – Ideal for those with no credit history.Recommended Credit Cards for Beginners:• Chime Credit Builder Card – No credit check required.• Capital One Platinum Secured Card – Low security deposit.• Discover It Secured Credit Card – Offers cashback rewards.• Self Credit Builder Loan – Helps build credit over time.2. Apply for a Secured Credit CardIf you are new to credit, a secured credit card is your best option. These cards require a security deposit, which determines your credit limit. After making on-time payments for a few months, you may qualify for an unsecured credit card with better benefits.3. Get a Co-Signer or Become an Authorized User• Co-Signer: A co-signer with good credit can guarantee your loan, increasing your chances of approval.• Authorized User: Becoming an authorized user on a family member’s or friend’s credit card allows you to build credit without full responsibility for payments.4. Prepare Your DocumentsBefore applying for a loan or credit card, ensure you have: ✔ Social Security Number (SSN) or ITIN✔ Proof of income (Pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements)✔ Utility bill or lease agreement (for address verification)What if you don’t have a stable income?• Show self-employment income (freelancing, small business, etc.).• Apply for student credit cards, which have lower income requirements.5. Apply at the Right TimeAvoid applying for multiple loans or credit cards at once, as this can negatively impact your credit score. Instead, research beginner-friendly lenders and apply strategically.Final ThoughtsBuilding credit and getting approved for a loan or credit card in the USA takes time and smart planning. By following these steps, you can improve your chances of approval and build a strong credit history for the future.For more financial tips, visit Smart Loan Tips.” ― MoneyMastery"},{"quote":"“Financial analysts in pin-striped suits do not like being compared to bare-assed apes.

For the game to be realistic, such delays have to be taken into account when rendering reality on the screen. The challenge for the network programmer is to make these asymmetries as invisible as possible so that the game seem 'equitable to everyone.' The problem is similar in finance, where the physical distance from the stock exchange's matching engines matters tremendously, requiring a similar solution to the problem of latency: simulating the most likely state of the order book on the firm's computers in order to estimate the most advantageous strategies or the firm's trading algorithms.

In the only terms that matter to the long-term investor - the real rate of return - he [the stockholder] got paid more like three times what the bondholder did. Why would an efficient market, over more than three quarters of a centry, pay the holders of one asset class anything like three times what it paid the holders of the other major asset class? Most people would say: risk. Is it really risk that's driving the premium returns, or is it volatility? It's volatility.... I invite you to look carefully at these dirty dozen disasters: the twelve bear markets of roughly 20% or more in the S&P 500 since the end of WWII. For the record, the average decline took about thirteen months from peak to trough, and carried the index down just about 30%. And since there've been twelve of these \"disasters\" in the roughly sixty years since war's end, we can fairly say that, on average, the stock market in this country has gone down about 30% about one year in five....

Variable annuitization offers genuine hope to people who (a) need to live on more than six percent of their capital, (b) need their income to grow in some relation to equity returns, which have historically been more than three times the inflation rate, and (c) at the very, very least, need to be assured that some income will continue for their entire lives. Variable annuitization is the only chance these people have. ...If Americans understood how the capital markets actually work, most folks would choose variable universal life insurance over variable life and whole life as the cheapest form of permanent insurance they could buy for the long run. That's simply because the insurance cost of an insurance policy is a pure function of how much of its own money the insurance company has exposed. Since the policyholder's own cash value builds up most significantly over time - and therefore the insurance company's exposure falls further, faster - in variable universal policies than in other debt-based (or general account-based) contracts, the net premium dollars allocated to the purchase of the death benefit must be lower, at the end of the day.

What's the concept in an operating real estate REIT? Operating real estate (as distinct from net leases or mortgages, which are other financing concepts) has the potential to produce equity-like long-term returns, but isan extremely powerful diversifier, in that real estate correlates positively with inflation while stocks and bonds correlate negatively with it. Inflation, with it attendant higher interest rates, chokes off new supply of real estate: new expensive to build, to expensive to finance at prevailing market rents. When new supply dwindles, normal growth absorbs the available space and puts upward pressure on rents, increasing cash flows to the owners... until rents get to a point where new construction pencils out again. (Meanwhile, in an inflation/interest rate flareup of any consequence, stocks and bonds are usually getting hit, and sometimes hit hard.) This, to me, is a trifecta of a conceptual value proposition: (a) the potential for the equity-like long-term returns investors need, (b) historically correlated positively with inflation, unlike all financial assets, and (c) just when you think this story can't get better, with 90% of available income paid out currently to income-starved investors.... What's the concept for variable life insurance? It's certainly the least expensive long-term form of life insurance, in that, as the investment portion grows, it extinguishes the insurance company's exposure. (As Ben Baldwin gnomically and brilliantly observes, 'All insurance is term insurance.') It may also be, in a given situation, the cheapest way of funding an estate tax liability, leaving the maximum legacy to one's heirs. And, of course, if the ownership is vested in an insurance trust, one may (under current law at this writing) be bequeathing wealth without income or estate taxation. As long as there is an estate tax - any estate tax - there will be a financial planning issue in the life of every affluent household/family: how do you want the heirs to pay it?

Because the pool of capital that made up an IRA could not be withdrawn for twenty or thirty years, many people viewed their IRAs as containing money they could experiment with. They could use an IRA to buy their first stock or their first mutual fund. They could put in in a money market fund first, and then, as they got bolder - and the bull market became more irresistible - shift some of it into something a little riskier. IRAs gave people a way to try on the stock and bond markets for size, to see how they felt, and to become slowly comfortable with the idea of investing. The knowledge that the money couldn't easily be withdrawn acted as a psychological safety net, allowing investors to feel as though they could take a chance or two. If they made a mistake, they reasoned, there was still time to recoup - several decades, perhaps.Over time, many people came to believe that it as imperative to maximize the returns they were getting on their IRA account, even at the risk of taking a loss.

And so they fear competition and attach themselves to their shadows. Such path drives one towards materialism rather than spiritualism. So what’s the difference between such individuals and those that work in the hope of quitting their job? Well, the main difference is that materialist people separate the two realities in the hope they can earn money from the work they love and then quit the work they don’t like. And by creating such division they remain there, in the middle, trapped. They think that by following what they love to do, step by step, they’ll be guided towards the right direction. But if their thoughts were clear, they would know they’re diving themselves and perpetuating their fate, rather than solving it. They neglect the mental barriers stopping them from achieving their goal. And anyone is responsible for determining the result that one holds in his thoughts. In other words, if you had not made such division in the first place, and instead accepted the lack of duality, you would achieve your result much faster. That is why almost all entrepreneurs rather work hard and be poor when starting a business than waiting for the right time to quit their job. There’s not such thing as the right time, or a shift from one reality unto another, because you create both things, your fortune and your unfortunate, and you own your luck and results, all the time.

It's secondary, it's parasitic. It's only a sort of hypertrophied, uncontrolled counting-house which has become dominant by falsifying the entries and intercepting payment.

They don't even control Westminster and Washington. They just watch things in order to make speculative anticipations. They've got minds that lie in wait like spiders, until the fly flies wrong. Then comes the debt entanglement. Which you can break, like the cobweb it is, if only you insist on playing the wasp. I ask you again what real strength has Finance if you tackle Finance? You can tax it, regulate its operations, print money over it without limit, cancel its claims. You can make moratoriums and jubilees.
