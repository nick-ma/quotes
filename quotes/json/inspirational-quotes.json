Although rape and child molestation are ubiquitous, we do not have campaigns for “humane” rape or “humane” child molestation. We condemn it all. We should do the same with respect to animal exploitation. Second, animal welfare reform does not provide significant protection for animal interests. Animals are chattel property; they are economic commodities. Given this status and the reality of markets, the level of protection provided by animal welfare will generally be limited to what promotes efficient exploitation. That is, we will protect animal interests to the extent that it provides an economic benefit.” ― GaryLFrancione"},{"quote":"“Many things that don't really mean so much of anything, are wonderful.” ― C.

Kiosks at Disneyland would see it so our parents could make it through a day of fun, our mom's book club would be one big blow-fest and instead of \"mommy juice\" it would be called \"mommy powder\" There'd be coke-tasting parties in Napa and cocaine cellars in fancy people's homes, and everyone we know (including our pastors, nurses, teachers, coaches, bosses) would snort it. The message we'd pick up as kids could be Cocaine is great, and one day you'll get to try it, too! Just don't become addicted to it or take it too far. Try it; use it responsibly. Don't become a cocaine-oholic though. Now, I'm sure you're thinking. That's insane, everyone knows cocaine is far more addicting than alcohol and far more dangerous. Except, it's not...The point is not that alcohol is worse than cocaine. The point is that we have a really clear understanding that cocaine is toxic and addictive. We know there's no safe amount of it, no such thing as \"moderate\" cocaine use; we know it can hook us and rob us of everything we care about...We know we are better off not tangling with it at all.” ― Holly Whitaker, Quit Like a Woman: The Radical Choice to Not Drink in a Culture Obsessed with Alcohol"},{"quote":"“Waiting is wasting.

There are laws that supposedly protect animal interestsin being treated “humanely,” but that term is interpreted in large part to mean that we cannot impose “unnecessary” harm on animals, and that is measured by what treatment is considered as necessary within particular industries, and according to customs of use, to exploit animals. The bottom line is that animals do not have any respect-based rights in the way that humans have, because we do not regard animals as having any moral value. They have only economic value. We value their interests economically, and we ignore their interests when it is economically beneficial for us to do so.At this point in time, it makes no sense to focus on the law, because as long as we regard animals as things, as a moral matter, the laws will necessarily reflect that absence of moral value and continue to do nothing to protect animals.

Animals are property and it costs money to protect their interests; therefore, the level of protection accorded to animal interests will always be low and animals will, under the best of circumstances, still be treated in ways that would constitute torture if applied to humans.By endorsing welfare reforms that supposedly make exploitation more “compassionate” or single-issue campaigns that falsely suggest that there is a coherent moral distinction between meat and dairy or between fur and wool or between steak and foie gras, we betray the principle of justice that says that all sentient beings are equal for purposes of not being used exclusively as human resources.

Welfare reforms make animal exploitation more profitable by eliminating practices that are economically vulnerable. For the most part, those changes would happen anyway and in the absence of animal welfare campaigns precisely because they do rectify inefficiencies in the production process. And welfare reforms make the public more comfortable about animal exploitation. The “happy” meat/animal products movement is clear proof of that. We would never advocate for “humane” or \"happy” human slavery, rape, genocide, etc. So, if we believe that animals matter morally and that they have an interest not only in not suffering but in continuing to exist, we should not be putting our time and energy into advocating for “humane” or “happy” animal exploitation.” ― GaryLFrancione"},{"quote":"“If we take the position that an assessment that veganism is morally preferable to vegetarianism is not possible because we are all “on our own journey,” then moral assessment becomes completely impossible or is speciesist. It is impossible because if we are all “on our own journey,” then there is nothing to say to the racist, sexist, anti-semite, homophobe, etc. If we say that those forms of discrimination are morally bad, but, with respect to animals, we are all “on our own journey” and we cannot make moral assessments about, for instance, dairy consumption, then we are simply being speciesist and not applying the same moral analysis to nonhumans that we apply to the human context.” ― GaryLFrancione"},{"quote":"“Speciesism is morally objectionable because, like racism, sexism, and heterosexism, it links personhood with an irrelevant criterion.

If “animal rights” means anything, it means that we cannot morally justify any animal exploitation; we cannot justify creating animals as human resources, however “humane” that treatment may be.We must stop thinking that people will find veganism “daunting” and that we have to promote something less than veganism. If we explain the moral ideas and the arguments in favor of veganism clearly, people will understand. They may not all go vegan immediately; in fact, most won’t. But we should always be clear about the moral baseline. If someone wants to do less as an incremental matter, let that be her/his decision, and not something that we advise to do. The baseline should always be clear.

Yes to the first part; no to the second. There is no coherent distinction between flesh and other animal products. They are all the same and we cannot justify consuming any of them. To say that you do not eat flesh but that you eat dairy or eggs or whatever, or that you don’t wear fur but you wear leather or wool, is like saying that you eat the meat from spotted cows but not from brown cows; it makers no sense whatsoever. The supposed “line” between meat and everything else is just a fantasy–an arbitrary distinction that is made to enable some exploitation to be segmented off and regarded as “better” or as morally acceptable. This is not a condemnation of vegetarians who are not vegans; it is, however, a plea to those people to recognize their actions do not conform with a moral principle that they claim to accept and that all animal products are the result of imposing suffering and death on sentient beings. It is not a matter of judging individuals; it is, however, a matter of judging practices and institutions.

In science, those who subscribe to one paradigm are often unable to understand and engage those who subscribe to another paradigm precisely because the theoretical language that they use is not compatible.I think that the situation is similar in the context of the debate between animal rights and animal welfare.

Me and myself, my reflection and I, we are not of that ilk, we aren’t ones to comply. We aren’t ones to conform or accept that the norm is a one-size-fits-all way to simply exist for we strive to be different, incredible, unique. Not irrelevant, invisible, insignificant or meek.

Well done! said the prince. How did you gain such skill? Putting down his knife, Ting said, I follow the Tao, Your Highness, which goes beyond all skills. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox. After three years, I had learned to look beyond the ox. Nowadays I see with my whole being, not with my eyes. I sense the natural lines, and my knife slides through by itself, never touching a joint, much less a bone. A good cook changes knives once a year: he cuts. An ordinary cook changes knives once a month: he hacks. This knife of mine has lasted for nineteen years; it has cut up thousands of oxen, but its blade is as sharp as if it were new. Between the joints there are spaces, and the blade has no thickness. Having no thickness, it slips right through; there’s more than enough room for it. And when I come to a difficult part, I slow down, I focus my attention, I barely move, the knife finds its way, until suddenly the flesh falls apart on its own. I stand there and let the joy of the work fill me. Then I wipe the blade clean and put it away. Bravo! cried the prince.

I have seen the homeless jostle for a sliver of concrete beneath the bridges, claiming a patch of cold ground for the night. I have watched children, their eyes too old for their faces, sift through reeking bins for scraps of food, numbed to the stench of decay. Desperate souls, stripped of dignity, stretch out their hands not for help, but for mere alms. The streets are a river of bowed heads and shadowed faces, a silent procession of the forgotten. In this city, does anyone remember how to smile?“Someone must do something!” The cry echoed in my mind, aimed at the distant, powerful figures: the government in its marble halls, the outspoken Christian leaders, the lavish politicians, the wealthy executives in their glass towers. I searched the faces around me, hoping to see a hero, one man who might rise above his own struggles to lift up another. I found none. A profound sadness settled over me, a grief for a humanity that seemed to have lost not only its way but its very soul.Seeking refuge from the biting wind and the even harsher reality of the streets, I pushed open the door to a restaurant. Warmth washed over me. An imposing mirror framed in sleek aluminium and rich wood adorned the entrance, a testament to a world of curated beauty and comfort.I caught my own reflection and instinctively straightened my coat. But the man staring back at me was a stranger—a coward, a man who had surrendered. I saw a light long ago dimmed by overwhelming circumstance, a voice silenced before it could even whisper a protest, a fighter who had shamefully fled the ring while the real battle raged just outside the door.The truth struck me with the force of a physical blow. The prayer I had been casting outward had no recipient. The hero I was waiting for would never come.In that crystal-clear moment, without a second thought, I turned and strode back onto the street. But I was not returning to search for the light. I was returning as the light. A radiant, defiant joy overflowed my heart. I had found my reason to live. I would not solve everything, but I could do something. I would shine, however faintly, and impact life, one person at a time.” ― Abiodun Fijabi"},{"quote":"“It’s A New Day!The light of a new day breaks through my window. Sunlight washes over me, and a soft wind billows the curtains, brushing them against my face. I gather the fabric in my hands, holding it like a flag raised to greet the morning.I linger there for a moment, until a dull throbbing in my temples reminds me of a night with too little sleep. I move slowly back to my bed, cradling my head in my hands. *Why only twenty-four hours?* The question arises automatically, and just as quickly, I remember the counsel I’ve been given: to seek more is a symptom of stress, a lack of trust in the time I’ve already been given.*What’s on the agenda today?* I ask myself, almost by rote. Instantly, my mind lurches into gear, racing through a mental catalog of appointments and obligations. The sheer weight of it all overwhelms me, and the headache returns with a vengeance. As I press my palms to my temples, the unfinished tasks and failures from yesterday come rushing back. The pain sharpens, forcing me to sit on the edge of the bed, unsteady.How long will I be held hostage by yesterday and paralyzed by tomorrow? I lie back, my gaze fixed on the blank expanse of the ceiling. I consciously tune it all out, making the effort to turn my heart toward my Father. Slowly, then surely, I find a quiet solace in His presence. From that peace, I draw the strength to learn from yesterday without being chained to it.In that stillness, my perspective shifts. Today—this single, present day—emerges as the only currency I have. It is the only space in which I can choose joy, and the only time I have to deploy my unique gifts upon a world that is waiting. It’s a new day; I am poised to take maximum advantage of it.” ― Abiodun Fijabi"},{"quote":"“Impossible? Bring it on!I once believed it was impossible... until I proved myself wrong.When the challenge loomed, a profound darkness filled my vision. Fear, cold and sharp, swept away every shred of confidence I possessed. My own whispers amplified the terror, echoing it in my ears. In that moment, I realized the darkness had claimed *me*. Its grip was absolute.Amidst the whirlwind of my surrender, a gentle yet insistent voice arose: \"Is this truly who you are?\" Shame washed over me. Swiftly, I changed my inner chant. \"Yes. I *can*,\" I breathed. The words, hesitant at first, gained strength with each repetition, forging resolve.Emboldened, I faced the darkness anew. Now, I saw it for what it was: not a monstrous force, but simply the absence of light. *My* light. The challenge lost its dread, revealing itself as something needing illumination, not fearing.I stepped forward, extending my light into the void. Joy surged as I watched the shadows recoil and scatter before its steady beam.Impossible? I choose that word with care now. I look upward, I look within, and draw upon the strength that transforms the impossible into possibility.” ― Abiodun Fijabi"},{"quote":"“Breaking the cycle isn’t glamorous.

When we're prayerless, we risk becoming righteous in our own eyes, but not in God's. Our self-righteousness can be a barrier to true spiritual growth and intimacy with God.

But what happens when the cheers fade? When the drums fall silent and the crowd moves on? When the praise that once lifted you now lifts another? Will you still sing when no one is listening? The truth is, applause is fleeting. Change is the only constant. The spotlight doesn’t belong to you—it merely passes by. If you’re good, remember: someone is better. There will always be someone wealthier, more beautiful, more captivating. Chasing approval is a race without a finish line. Imagine building your life on the applause of others—shaping every choice, every belief, just to please the crowd. You’ll never measure up. You’ll trade your convictions for trends, your dignity for nods of approval. Stripped of authenticity, you’ll wear borrowed robes, never truly your own. The wise stand beyond the applause. They live behind the curtain of public opinion, anchored in what lasts: love for God, devotion to family, the pursuit of true joy, and faith that overcomes. They welcome praise but aren’t defined by it. Their worth comes from something deeper. So when the clapping ends, they keep singing. Because their song was never for the crowd—it was for the soul.

To the untrained eye, the waiting vulture seems foolish—but its patience is not passivity. It is strategy and intentionality in motion, turning restraint into reward, trading haste for precision. Patience is not mere inconvenience—it is necessity. Though it may feel like time wasted, its true cost is only short-term. Waiting sharpens focus, hones skill, and prepares you for what lies ahead. It clears the mind of bias, aligns action with purpose, and leads to wiser choices. In patience, energy is preserved, and ability is refined. It is the cure for reckless impulse. No victory comes without patience. Only faith that is accompanied by patience inherit the promise of a desired end.

Counting losses consumes us; we forget to number our days or summon past victories. Ambition flickers, fading.Yet, we dare to lift our gaze and murmur a prayer to God. Slowly, gratitude seeps in, mending the fractured spirit. And there, in the profound darkness, a sliver of light appears. Not a flood, but a persistent glow that swells, banishing the pitch black, saturating the void. This transforming light shifts our vision. Despair loosens its grip; hope stirs. Smiles begin to thaw frozen tears. A forgotten strength wells within.Forged in this newfound resilience, we rise. Not merely to stand, but to rebound – launching us higher than ground we once knew. Where the fall sought to cast down, it has become the lift upward. A chapter presumed closed bursts open, spilling with unforeseen possibilities.
